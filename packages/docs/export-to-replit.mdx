title: Export to Replit
---

Subframe generates React code for your designs which you can export directly to [Replit](/export-to-replit), [Bolt](/export-to-bolt), or [Cursor](/export-to-cursor) to speed up development. We've created prompts optimized for Replit, or you can export manually.

### Open Code Mode
1. Click **Code** in the top right of your page to open **Code Mode**.
2. Select **Export to Replit**.

### Set up your Replit project
To sync your Subframe components with Replit, you'll need to install it for your project. If you're starting fresh, we recommend using **Replit Vite template**, but you can use any framework you prefer.

1. Go to the **Setup your Replit project** section in **Code Mode**.
2. Click **Open Replit** to create a new Vite app.
3. Click **Generate Replit Prompt** â€” this will create an installation prompt that sets up Subframe and installs any required dependencies.
4. Copy the generated prompt and paste it into **Replit Assistant** to run the setup.

### Export your design to Replit
You can export an entire page or a specific selection from Subframe to Replit.

1. Copy the **Export to Replit** prompt and paste it into **Replit Assistant**. This will sync your components and copy over your design code.
2. In Replit, modify the prompt as needed to:
    * Create a new page
    * Update an existing page
    * [Add additional logic or connections](/adding-business-logic)

Once exported, your design is ready to build on, connect to a backend, or deploy to production.
