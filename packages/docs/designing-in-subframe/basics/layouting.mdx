title: Adjusting Layout
description: Change the location of child elements relative to each other

Subframe uses a CSS flexbox model underneath the hood. That means common CSS layout properties like flex-direction and gap translate directly to layout properties in Subframe. That also means most layout properties are updated from the parent, not the child. As an example, space between two elements is adjusted by first selecting their parent.

 
You will find layout properties on the right-hand side under Layout. These properties like direction and child spacing are only available for a Stack element. You can create stacks by [grouping elements together](https://help.subframe.com/en/articles/9334563-adjust-flex-direction-spacing-and-alignment#:~:text=You%20will%20find%20layout%20properties%20on%20the%20right%2Dhand%20side%20under%20Layout.%20These%20properties%20like%20direction%20and%20child%20spacing%20are%20only%20available%20for%20a%20Stack%20element.%20You%20can%20create%20stacks%20by%20grouping%20elements%20together%2C%20which%20wraps%20them%20in%20a%20stack.), which wraps them in a stack.
