title: Creating AI prototypes
description: Learn how to create interactive prototypes from your designs using Subframe's AI-powered prototyping features.

<Note>This feature is currently in beta and available for Pro users only.</Note>

## How Subframe prototyping works

Subframe uses annotations to transform static designs into interactive prototypes. Annotations are comments on design elements that explain how they should function.

Annotations serve two purposes:

- They appear as comments in generated code for developer handoff
- AI uses them to understand functionality and build interactive prototypes

## Creating a prototype

/>

1. Complete your designs in design mode
2. Switch to **Prototype** mode using the toggle in the top-right corner
3. Click on elements in your design and add annotations describing functionality
4. Add more pages to your prototype if needed via the right panel
5. Click the **Build** button to build the prototype

## Updating a prototype

#### Changing styles

1. Make changes in design mode, then go back to prototype mode
2. Click **Update** to apply changes to your existing prototype

#### Changing functionality

1. Update the annotations on the design elements
2. Click **Update** to apply changes to your existing prototype

#### Fixing a broken prototype

For small functionality changes, use **Quick fix** to update the prototype.

1. Click **Quick fix**
2. Describe the changes you want to make
3. AI will apply targeted updates to your prototype

Sometimes the prototype gets stuck or needs a fresh start. To do this, click **Rebuild** to generate the prototype from scratch.
