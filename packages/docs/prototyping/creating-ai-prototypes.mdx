## How Subframe prototyping works

Subframe follows a design-first workflow: create your designs for pages in a flow, then bring them to life with a real interactive prototype.

There are two main ways to prompt your prototype with AI:

1. **Annotations**: Add comments to your designs to explain how they should function.
2. **Chat with AI**: Prompt your prototype by asking AI to make changes.

Both annotations and chat prompts help AI generate code for your functional prototype that matches your designs exactly.

<Info>
  Tip: use annotations for hand-off â€“ they appear as inline comments in exported code for developer.

## Creating a prototype

<video autoPlay muted loop playsInline className="w-full" src="https://hevpkratkeuc60w7.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/Mintlify/creating-prototypes-z4bcfmhmbnZH5wDZKyHOQgYfEm2qct.mp4" />

1. Create a page in **Design** mode.
2. Switch to **Prototype** mode using the toggle in the top-right corner.
3. Add annotations to describe the functionality for specific elements.
4. Click the **Apply** button to create the first version of your prototype.

<Info>
  Note: Every prototype is part of a flow that contains the pages included in the prototype. Create a new flow and add pages to it to create more prototypes.

## Updating a prototype

Every time you apply design changes, modify annotations, or send a prompt, Subframe creates a new version of your prototype.

#### Making design changes

1. Switch to **Design** mode to make updates to your pages.
2. Add additional pages to a flow to add them to your prototype.
3. Switch to **Prototype** mode.
4. Click **Apply** to update your prototype with new designs.

#### Updating annotations

1. Click the **Annotate** button in the top nav or in the prototype chat bar.
2. Edit existing annotations or add new ones across any page in the flow.
3. Click **Apply** to update your prototype with new annotations.

### Prompting via chat

1. Switch to **Prototype** mode to view the conversation history for the prototype.
2. In the prototype chat bar, add a prompt to make changes to your prototype.
3. Click send to update your prototype.

<Info>
  If your prototype gets stuck or needs a fresh start, click **Start over** to rebuild your prototype from your designs and annotations.
