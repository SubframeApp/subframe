<Note>
  Subframe works with any framework that uses Typescript, React, and Tailwind CSS. 
</Note>

Run the following command in the root of your repository to install Subframe and configure your project:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npx @subframe/cli@latest init
  ```
  ```bash yarn
  yarn @subframe/cli@latest init
  ```
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm @subframe/cli@latest init
  ```
  ```bash bun
  bunx @subframe/cli@latest init
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If you're starting a new project, you can choose one of our starter templates that are optimized to work well with Subframe out of the box.

```
