When you're building complex apps with multiple frontends, it's often useful to have use a monorepo setup so you can import the same components into many different apps. This guide will show you how to set up Subframe components in your own monorepo.

<Note>
  For this guide we'll be assuming that you're using [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) as your monorepo and [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) for your frontend. Monorepo-specific functionality should work with any package manager or framework that supports [workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces?v=true). For more information visit the [manual installation guide](/getting-started/framework-guides/manual) and the framework guide for your frontend of choice. 
</Note>

## Create your package

Since we're using Turborepo, we can use the `turbo generate` command to create a package in our monorepo where we'll be importing our Subframe components. We'll be creative and call the package `@repo/subframe`.

<Tip>
  If you're using a different monorepo framework or just plain workspaces, you can just duplicate an existing package directory and change the contents accordingly.
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash npm
  npx turbo generate workspace --name @repo/subframe --type package
  ```
  ```bash yarn
  yarn turbo generate workspace --name @repo/subframe --type package
  ```
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm turbo generate workspace --name @repo/subframe --type package
  ```
  ```bash bun
  bunx turbo generate workspace --name @repo/subframe --type package
  ```

</CodeGroup>

On the interactive prompt, make sure to select your monorepo's TypeScript and ESLint config packages as `devDependencies` for the next step. 

We'll also want to integrate our monorepo's TypeScript and ESLint configuration, so we'll create the following two files:

<CodeGroup>

  ```javascript packages/subframe/eslint.config.mjs 
  import { config } from "@repo/eslint-config/react-internal";

  /** @type {import("eslint").Linter.Config} */
  export default config;
  ```

  ```json packages/subframe/tsconfig.json 
  {
    "extends": "@repo/typescript-config/react-library.json",
    "compilerOptions": {
      "outDir": "dist"
    },
    "include": ["ui"],
    "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
  }
  ```

</CodeGroup>

## Initialize Subframe

Now that we've created our package, we want to sync our Subframe components into the repository. Let's do so by running the `@subframe/cli init` command.


<CodeGroup>

  ```bash npm
  cd packages/subframe && npx @subframe/cli@latest init --sync --dir ui
  ```
  ```bash yarn
  cd packages/subframe && yarn @subframe/cli@latest init --sync --dir ui
  ```
  ```bash pnpm
  cd packages/subframe && pnpm @subframe/cli@latest init --sync --dir ui
  ```
  ```bash bun
  cd packages/subframe && bunx --bun @subframe/cli@latest init --sync --dir ui
  ```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Make sure that you set the import alias to `@repo/subframe/*` during the initialization process. This will make sure that the code imports from Subframe will work within our UI apps later. 
  If you forgot to set it, simply edit the importAlias key in your `.subframe/sync.json` file and run `@subframe/cli init` again to sync the changed import alias to your Subframe project.

  ```json packages/subframe/.subframe/sync.json {3}
  {
    "directory": "ui",
    "importAlias": "@repo/subframe/*"
  }
  ```

</Warning>

## Export Subframe components from your package

To be able to import our components from this package in other apps in the monorepo, we'll have to make sure they can find the components within our package, as well as Subframe's TailwindCSS config. 
We can easily achieve this by setting the `exports` field in our `package.json` accordingly:


```json packages/subframe/package.json {5-10}
{
  "name": "@repo/subframe",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "exports": {
    ".": "./ui/index.ts",
    "./components/*": "./ui/components/*.tsx",
    "./layouts/*": "./ui/layouts/*.tsx",
    "./tailwind-config": "./ui/tailwind.config.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@subframe/core": "^1.141.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@repo/eslint-config": "*",
    "@repo/typescript-config": "*"
  }
}

```

## Install the `@repo/subframe` package into your app

To install your local package to your app, add the following line to your frontend apps `dependencies`:


<CodeGroup>

  ```text apps/web/package.json (npm and yarn)
  "@repo/subframe": "*"
  ```
  ```text apps/web/package.json (pnpm and bun)
  "@repo/subframe": "workspace:*"
  ```

</CodeGroup>

Then run your package manager's `install` command to link your dependencies:

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash npm
  npm install
  ```
  ```bash yarn
  yarn install
  ```
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm install
  ```
  ```bash bun
  bun install
  ```

</CodeGroup>

## Set up TailwindCSS in your frontend app

<Note>
  We'll assume you've already set up TailwindCSS (v3) for your frontend app. If you haven't done so, follow the [TailwindCSS getting started](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss).
</Note>

The difference to a usual setup here is that we need to import Subframe's tailwind config `preset` from our local package, as well as include our Subframe components source files in tailwind's `content` array:


```javascript apps/web/tailwind.config.js {8, 14}
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./ui/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "../../packages/subframe/ui/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
  presets: [require("@repo/subframe/tailwind-config")],
};
```

## Use Subframe components in your app

You can now import all of your Subframe components directly into your app. Since the import alias was also changed to the name of your local package, all imports generated by the Subframe app will resolve to the components in your `@repo/subframe` package!

You now have your Subframe components set up to use in your app. You can now go ahead and use them in your project.
