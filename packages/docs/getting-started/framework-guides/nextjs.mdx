If you just want to get setup with NextJS and Subframe quickly, you can follow the [quickstart guide](/getting-started/quickstart). If you want to set up Subframe in your NextJS app manually, you can follow the steps below.

<Note>
    This guide assumes that you already have Tailwind set up in your NextJS app. If you don't, please follow the [Installation guide for NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/installation) and the [TailwindCSS guide for setting up Tailwind in your NextJS app using PostCSS](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss).
</Note>

## Initialize Subframe

To be able to sync our components within our NextJS app and use them, we will need to initialize the project and configure it to be able to style Subframe.

The easiest way of doing so is the Subframe CLI, which will initialize the project for you and set up some necessary configurations.

The following command will set up Subframe in your project.

<CodeGroup>
    ```bash npm
    npx @subframe/cli@latest init
    ```
    ```bash yarn
    yarn @subframe/cli@latest init
    ```
    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm exec @subframe/cli@latest init
    ```
    ```bash bun
    bunx --bun @subframe/cli@latest init
    ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
    Should you run into any trouble with the automated installation, have a look at the [manual installation guide](/getting-started/framework-guides/manual).
</Info>

You now have your Subframe components set up to use in your app. You can now go ahead and use them in your project.
