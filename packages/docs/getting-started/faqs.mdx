## Can I import my existing component library?

As of the time of writing, Subframe does not support importing your existing component library.
However, we are working on a feature that will allow you to import your existing components into Subframe. Stay tuned and join our [Community Slack](http://localhost:3000/faqs/index#:~:text=FAQs-,Community,-Blog) to be the first to know when the feature drops!

## How does this integrate with Cursor/Replit/Bolt?

We've created prompts that will allow you to export your Subframe components to Cursor, Replit, and Bolt.
You can find more information in the [Working with AI](/developing-with-subframe/building-with-ai) page.  

## What are best practices for adding custom logic to my components?

We recommend wrapping your Subframe components in your own components. This way, you can make changes to the component without having to unsync it. For more information, see the [Adding Business Logic](/developing-with-subframe/basics/adding-business-logic) page.

## Why do I not see my pages in my codebase after I sync?

Pages are meant to be copy/pasted from the Subframe editor into your codebase while components are meant to be synced. For more information, see the [Copy vs Sync](/developing-with-subframe/best-practices/copy-vs-sync) page.

## How does Subframe compare to Webflow/Framer/Figma?

Subframe is primarily a design tool that generates React code. It's meant to be used alongside your existing design tools and codebase to empower you to build your own app with your own code.     

## Will my codebase keep working if I cancel my subscription/Subframe shuts down?

Yes! All of your code is synced to your own codebase and yours to keep. All core libraries that Subframe components depend on are [open source](https://github.com/SubframeApp/subframe) and will remain accessible to you should you cancel your subscription or if Subframe shuts down.

## Can I import my designs from Figma?

Yes! Using our AI agent, you can copy your designs from Figma and ask the AI agent to regenerate the design in Subframe.


## How do I get support?

You can join our [Community Slack](http://localhost:3000/faqs/index#:~:text=FAQs-,Community,-Blog) to get support from the Subframe team and other developers.
