<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I import my existing component library?">
    At the time of writing, Subframe does not support importing your existing component library.
    However, we are working on a feature that will allow you to import your existing components into Subframe. Stay tuned and join our [Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/subframecommunity/shared_invite/zt-2gcv0nlow-qO_3pM3ZfNVGXZTWHVfwVw) to be the first to know when the feature drops!
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does Subframe integrate with Cursor/Replit/Bolt?">
    We've created prompts that will allow you to export your Subframe components to Cursor, Replit, and Bolt.
    You can find more information on our [Building with AI](/developing-with-subframe/building-with-ai) pages.  
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How to I add logic to my Subframe components?">
    We recommend wrapping your Subframe components in your own logical components. This way, you can make changes to the component without having to unsync them. For more information, see the [Adding Business Logic](/developing-with-subframe/basics/adding-business-logic) page.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why do I not see my pages in my codebase after I sync?">
    Pages are meant to be copy/pasted from the Subframe editor into your codebase while components are meant to be synced. For more information, see the [Copy vs Sync](/developing-with-subframe/best-practices/copy-vs-sync) page.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does Subframe compare to Webflow/Framer/Figma?">
    Subframe is primarily a design tool that generates React code. It's meant to be used alongside your existing design tools and codebase to empower you to build your own app with your own code.     
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will my code keep working if I cancel my subscription?">
    Yes! All of your code is synced to your own codebase and yours to keep. All core libraries that Subframe components depend on are [open source](https://github.com/SubframeApp/subframe) and will remain accessible to you should you cancel your subscription or if Subframe should shut down at any point in the future.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I import my designs from Figma?">
    Yes! Using our AI agent, you can copy your designs from Figma and ask the AI agent to regenerate the design in Subframe.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I get support?">
    You can join our [Community Slack](http://localhost:3000/faqs/index#:~:text=FAQs-,Community,-Blog) to get support from the Subframe team and other developers.
