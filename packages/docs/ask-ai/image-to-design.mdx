title: Image to design
---

Upload screenshots or mockups and Ask AI to recreate designs using your components and theme.

## Upload an image

1. Click the **image icon** in the Ask AI toolbar or drag an image directly into the prompt area.
2. Add a prompt describing how to use the image
3. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to generate

AI analyzes the image and creates 1–4 variations that match the structure using your Subframe components.

Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, WebP

## Import from Figma

1. In Figma, select a frame to copy as PNG (right-click or press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>)
2. In Ask AI, paste the image into the prompt area
3. Add a prompt and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

## Tips

- Describe your intent and changes rather than just "recreate this"
- Mention specific components to use
- Generated designs approximate the image using your components
- Check all copy after–the image model may misread text
