title: MCP server
description: Let AI coding assistants directly access your Subframe designs and documentation.
---

Our MCP server lets AI coding assistants like Claude Code and Cursor access your Subframe designs directly. Instead of copying code manually, AI can fetch components, pages, and themes from your projects automatically.

We also have a separate Subframe Docs MCP server that provides access to Subframe documentation (this site).

## Installation

You can find full MCP setup instructions in the [Installation](/installation) page.

## Using the MCP server

Once configured, your AI assistant can access Subframe automatically when you prompt or paste an MCP link to a page from the Code panel.

You can get the MCP link for any design by either:

1. Copying the link from the browser address bar
2. Copying the link under **Code** > **Inspect** in Subframe

### Prompt with MCP link

When prompting we recommend using the MCP link found in the Code Inspect panel for a page.

```text
Implement the design at https://app.subframe.com/design/...
```

<Note>
  To get the latest version of components in your project, run `npx @subframe/cli@latest sync` to [sync
  components](/concepts/syncing-components).
</Note>

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Authentication failed">

Check that:

- Your API token is correct and hasn't expired
- You copied the entire token without extra spaces
- The token is in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN`

Generate a new token at [app.subframe.com/settings/tokens](https://app.subframe.com/settings/tokens).

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="AI not calling the server">

Make sure your AI tool:

- Has MCP support enabled
- Has the Subframe server in its MCP configuration
- Has been restarted after adding the configuration

Check your tool's logs for MCP-related errors.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Component or page not found">

Use `list_components` or `list_pages` to see what's available.

Verify:

- The component/page exists in your Subframe project
- The name or URL matches exactly
- You have access to the project

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Connection errors">

If the MCP server is unreachable:

- Check your internet connection
- Verify the URL is `https://mcp.subframe.com/mcp`
- Reach out to the Subframe team for support
