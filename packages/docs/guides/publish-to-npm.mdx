title: Publishing to NPM
description: Distribute components as a package.
---

For teams that want to distribute components as a package, set up a separate repository:

1. Create a new repo for your component library
2. Follow the [installation instructions](/installation) to initialize the project in that repo
3. Sync components to this repo
4. Publish to NPM with your standard workflow

Your apps can then install that package instead of syncing directly. If you need help with this, please join our [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/subframecommunity/shared_invite/zt-380uma6dv-_lr7_bDLU5DJcoygfUYkeQ) for additional support.
