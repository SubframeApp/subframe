description: Guided workflows that teach AI assistants how to design and implement UIs with Subframe.

[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) are structured instructions that teach AI assistants how to use tools correctly. The [MCP server](/guides/mcp-server) gives your AI assistant the _ability_ to access Subframe — skills give it the _knowledge_ of how to use Subframe well.

Skills are an [open standard](https://agentskills.io) adopted by companies like Supabase, Vercel, and Cloudflare.

## Available skills

**`/subframe:setup`** — Initializes Subframe in a new or existing project. Detects the framework, runs the CLI, configures Tailwind and fonts, and syncs components.

**`/subframe:design`** — Designs UI pages. Gathers context from your codebase, calls `design_page` to generate multiple variations, and returns a review URL where you can preview and select a variation.

**`/subframe:develop`** — Implements designs with business logic. Fetches the design via `get_page_info`, syncs components, places the page in your codebase, and wires up data fetching, forms, event handlers, and loading/error states.

## Typical workflow

1. Run `/subframe:setup` to initialize Subframe in your project (one-time)
2. Run `/subframe:design` to create a page design with multiple variations
3. Review and select a variation in Subframe
4. Run `/subframe:develop` to implement the selected design with business logic
