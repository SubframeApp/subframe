## Importing Subframe components in code

After syncing the components to your repository, you can use a Subframe component within your code, you can import it directly from your directory. For example, using the default alias of `@/ui/*`:

```tsx src/App.tsx {1, 5-10}
import { Alert } from "@/ui/components/Alert"

function App() {
  return (
    <Alert
      variant="neutral"
      icon="FeatherInfo"
      title="A great title for an alert"
      description="Describe what's happening in more detail."
    />
  )
}

export default App
```

## Viewing docs for a component

Subframe gives you a customizable design system that's exported as React code. You can add business logic to any exported Subframe component. To understand the React props available for a component, view its documentation.
