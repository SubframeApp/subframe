Subframe generates React code for your designs which you can export directly to your AI tool of choice to speed up development. We've created prompts optimized for Bolt, or you can export manually.

We've created prompts optimized for Bolt so you can get started quickly.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Code Mode">
    1. Click **Code** in the top right of your page to open **Code Mode**.
    2. Select **Export to Bolt**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up your Bolt project">
    To sync your Subframe components with Bolt, you'll need to install it for your project. If you're starting fresh, we recommend using the Bolt Vite template, but you can use any framework you prefer.

    1. Go to the **Setup your Bolt project** section in **Code Mode**.
    2. Click **Open Bolt** to create a new Vite app.
    3. Click **Generate Bolt Prompt** â€” this will create an installation prompt that sets up Subframe and installs any required dependencies.
    4. Copy the generated prompt and paste it into **Bolt chat** to run the setup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Export your design to Bolt">
    You can export an entire page or a specific selection from Subframe to Bolt.

    1. Copy the **Export to Bolt** prompt and paste it into **Bolt chat**. This will sync your components and copy over your design code.
    2. In Bolt, modify the prompt as needed to:
        * Create a new page
        * Update an existing page
        * [Add additional logic or connections](/developing-with-subframe/basics/adding-business-logic)
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once exported, your design is ready to build on, connect to a backend, or deploy to production.
