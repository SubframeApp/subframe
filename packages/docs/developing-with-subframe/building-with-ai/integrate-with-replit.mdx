Subframe generates React code for your designs which you can export directly to your AI tool of choice to speed up development. We've created prompts optimized for Bolt, or you can export manually.

We've created prompts optimized for Replit so you can get started quickly.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Code Mode">
    1. Click **Code** in the top right of your page to open **Code Mode**.
    2. Select **Export to Replit**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up your Replit project">
    To sync your Subframe components with Replit, you'll need to install it for your project. If you're starting fresh, we recommend using **Replit Vite template**, but you can use any framework you prefer.

    1. Go to the **Setup your Replit project** section in **Code Mode**.
    2. Click **Open Replit** to create a new Vite app.
    3. Click **Generate Replit Prompt** â€” this will create an installation prompt that sets up Subframe and installs any required dependencies.
    4. Copy the generated prompt and paste it into **Replit Assistant** to run the setup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Export your design to Replit">
    You can export an entire page or a specific selection from Subframe to Replit.

    1. Copy the **Export to Replit** prompt and paste it into **Replit Assistant**. This will sync your components and copy over your design code.
    2. In Replit, modify the prompt as needed to:
        * Create a new page
        * Update an existing page
        * [Add additional logic or connections](/developing-with-subframe/basics/adding-business-logic)
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once exported, your design is ready to build on, connect to a backend, or deploy to production.
