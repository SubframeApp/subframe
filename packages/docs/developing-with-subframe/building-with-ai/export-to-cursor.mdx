title: Export to Cursor
---


Subframe generates React code for your designs which you can export directly to your AI tool of choice to speed up development. We've created prompts optimized for Bolt, or you can export manually.

We've created prompts optimized for Cursor so you can get started quickly.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Code Mode">
    1. Click **Code** in the top right of your page to open **Code Mode**.
    2. Select **Export to Cursor**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up your Cursor project">
    To sync your Subframe components with Cursor, you'll need to install it for your project. If you're starting fresh, we recommend using our [Vite or Next.js starter kit](/getting-started/quickstart#setting-up-with-a-template), but you can use any framework you prefer.

    1. Go to the **Setup your Cursor project** section in **Code Mode**.
    2. Click **Open Cursor**.
    3. Click **Generate Cursor Prompt** â€” this will create an installation prompt that sets up Subframe and installs any required dependencies.
    4. Copy the generated prompt and paste it into **Cursor Agent** to run the setup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Export your design to Cursor">
    You can export an entire page or a specific selection from Subframe to Cursor.

    1. Copy the **Export to Cursor** prompt and paste it into **Cursor Agent**. This will sync your components and copy over your design code.
    2. In Cursor, modify the prompt as needed to:
        * Create a new page
        * Update an existing page
        * [Add additional logic or connections](/developing-with-subframe/basics/adding-business-logic)
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once exported, your design is ready to build on, connect to a backend, or deploy to production.
