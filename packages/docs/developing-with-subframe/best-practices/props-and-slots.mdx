title: Props and Slots

In Subframe, there's two main ways to customize the contents of a component; props and slots. You can use both to customize the contents of a component, but they serve different purposes and are used in different situations.


Props are used to customize "simple" parts of a component. Think text, image URLs, or other data that can be expressed as a simple data type. 

Slots are much more flexible and can be used to pass arbitrary React nodes down into your component. This is called the [React composition pattern](https://felixgerschau.com/react-component-composition/). Although since using slots can make a component more complex to work with, there's a balance to be struck between using props and slots, and the right choice depends on the specific use case.

The **TL;DR** is:

* Use props for changing simple content - text, image URLs, etc.
* Use slots when you have dynamic content, or need to access a subcomponent's props - `onClick`, `onChange`, `alt`, `src`, etc.

Let's have a look at the `<TrackCard />` component from the [previous example](/developing-with-subframe/basics/adding-business-logic#example-2-a-complex-custom-component) to see how this works in practice.

<CodeGroup>
    ```tsx src/components/TrackCard.tsx (with only props)
    "use client";
    import { TrackCardWithProps } from "@/ui/components/TrackCardWithProps";

    function TrackCardWithPropsExample() {
        const [isFavorite, setIsFavorite] = useState<boolean>(false);

        function handleFavoriteClick() {
            setIsFavorite((prev) => !prev);
        }

        const favoriteIcon = isFavorite ? "FeatherHeartOff" : "FeatherHeart";

        return (
            <TrackCardWithProps
                title="The Less I Know The Better"
                artist="Tame Impala"
                length="3:38"
                genre="Disco"
                // We can only pass a static image URL here and no alt text,
                // since the props for the underlying <img /> are not exposed
                image="/covers/tame_impala-currents.jpg"
                // We have no way to add an onClick handler or an icon to our 
                // FavoriteButton here, since it's events are not exposed
            />
        );
    }

    export default TrackCardWithPropsExample;
    ```

    ```tsx src/components/TrackCard.tsx (with slots)
    "use client";
    import { TrackCardWithSlots } from "@/ui/components/TrackCardWithSlots";
    import Image from 'next/image'

    function TrackCardWithSlotsExample() {
        const [isFavorite, setIsFavorite] = useState<boolean>(false);

        function handleFavoriteClick() {
            setIsFavorite((prev) => !prev);
        }

        const favoriteIcon = isFavorite ? "FeatherHeartOff" : "FeatherHeart";

        return (
            <TrackCardWithSlots
                title="The Less I Know The Better"
                artist="Tame Impala"
                length="3:38"
                // We can pass in an onClick handler
                // and icon to the FavoriteButton here, 
                // since it's props are now exposed
                favoriteButtonSlot={
                    <TrackCardWithSlots.FavoriteButton
                        icon={favoriteIcon}
                        onClick={handleFavoriteClick}
                    />
                }
                imageSlot={
                    // We can pass an arbitrary React node here
                    // such as Next's <Image /> component,
                    // allowing us to optimize images and add alt text
                    <Image
                        src="/covers/tame_impala-currents.jpg"
                        alt="Tame Impala Currents Cover Art"
                        fill={true}
                    />
                }
                genre="Disco"
            />
        );
    }

    export default TrackCardWithSlotsExample;
```

<Tip>
 **Protip:** We can use Subcomponents to expose props and slots to the consumer of a component while giving a hint which components are supposed to be used within that slot, as we've done with the `<TrackCardWithSlots.FavoriteButton />` subcomponent in the example above.
</Tip>

When used in conjunction with Subcomponents, you can make sure that you expose all the necessary props and slots to the consumer of a component while making sure that the component is easy to use and understand.
