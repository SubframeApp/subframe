Subframe gives you multiple ways to get the code from the components you designed in Subframe into your codebase.

You can both copy code directly from the Subframe editor, and sync components from Subframe to your codebase.

## What to copy and what to sync

The **TL;DR** is:

- **Copy/Paste** the code for pages from the Subframe editor
- **Sync** components from Subframe to your codebase

Why is that the case?

When we design a page, we design it statically. This means that we don't have any dynamic content (like mapping out multiple items) or any business logic (like a form).
Chances are, you'll need to edit the content of the page you copied over, with your designed page only providing a starting point for your own customizations.

When we design a component, we design it with the expectation that it will be used in multiple places with different data and keep up to date with layout and style changes in your deisng. This is why we expose props and slots, so that you can customize the component to your needs while keeping the core layout and styling editable.

  <Step title="Open the page editor" />
  <Step title="Select Code in the top-right of the nav to open the code panel" />
  <Step title="Select what content to copy">
    By default, the code panel will show the code for the entire page. You can select individual elements on the page to
    see a code snippet for your selection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the code you want to copy">
    The code panel will show the following for each page or selection: 1. Snippet to install/sync components. 2. List of
    imports. 3. Generated React + Tailwind CSS code.

## An example page

Let's have another look at the `<FavoriteTracks />` page from [adding business logic](/developing-with-subframe/basics/adding-business-logic#example-2-a-complex-custom-component).

<CodeGroup>

```tsx src/pages/FavoriteTracks.tsx (copied and pasted from Subframe) [expandable]
"use client"
import React from "react"
import { TrackCard } from "@/ui/components/TrackCard"

function FavoriteTracksPage() {
  return (
    <div className="container max-w-none flex h-full w-full flex-col items-start gap-4 bg-default-background py-12">
      <span className="text-heading-1 font-heading-1 text-default-font">Your favorite tracks of the week</span>
      <div className="flex w-full flex-wrap items-start gap-2 px-1 py-1">
        <TrackCard
          title="The Less I Know The Better"
          artist="Tame Impala"
          length="3:38"
          favoriteButtonSlot={<TrackCard.FavoriteButton />}
          imageSlot={
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/subframe/image/upload/v1741969641/uploads/925/oefuaafkotek1wqlmpyz.jpg" />
          }
          genre="Disco"
        />
        <TrackCard
          title="Shadowplay"
          artist="Joy Division"
          length="3:53"
          favoriteButtonSlot={<TrackCard.FavoriteButton />}
          imageSlot={
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/subframe/image/upload/v1741971326/uploads/925/psbp3yk4p0ajtdhfq4ne.jpg" />
          }
          genre="Post Punk"
        />
        <TrackCard
          title="Bohemian Rhapsody"
          artist="Queen"
          length="3:53"
          favoriteButtonSlot={<TrackCard.FavoriteButton />}
          imageSlot={<img src="/covers/tame_impala-currents.jpg" />}
          genre="Progressive Rock"
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default FavoriteTracks
```

</CodeGroup>

Here, the page's content is static. But we might want to show different tracks depending on what the user listened to last week.

So to render out content dynamically, we'll need to add some logic to the page. We'll edit it to use a `favoriteTracks` array, and map over it to render out the tracks with our custom built `<TrackCard />` component.

<CodeGroup>

```tsx src/pages/FavoriteTracks.tsx (edited, with dynamic content) {5-15, 17-51, 58-70} [expandable]
"use client"
import React from "react"
import { TrackCard } from "@/ui/components/TrackCard"

interface Track {
  title: string
  artist: string
  length: string
  genre: string
  coverImage: {
    alt: string
    src: string
  }
  isFavorite: boolean
}

const favoriteTracks: Track[] = [
  {
    title: "The Less I Know The Better",
    artist: "Tame Impala",
    length: "3:38",
    genre: "Disco",
    coverImage: {
      src: "/covers/tame_impala-currents.jpg",
      alt: "Tame Impala Currents Cover Art",
    },
    isFavorite: false,
  },
  {
    title: "Shadowplay",
    artist: "Joy Division",
    length: "3:53",
    genre: "Post Punk",
    coverImage: {
      src: "/covers/joy_division-unknown-pleasures.jpg",
      alt: "Joy Division Unknown Pleasures Cover Art",
    },
    isFavorite: true,
  },
  {
    title: "Bohemian Rhapsody",
    artist: "Queen",
    length: "3:53",
    genre: "Progressive Rock",
    coverImage: {
      src: "/covers/queen-bohemian_rhapsody.jpg",
      alt: "Queen Bohemian Rhapsody Cover Art",
    },
    isFavorite: false,
  },
]

function FavoriteTracksPage() {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
      <span className="text-heading-1 font-heading-1 text-default-font">Your favorite tracks of the week</span>
      <div className="flex w-full flex-wrap items-start gap-2 px-1 py-1">
        {favoriteTracks.map((track) => (
          <TrackCard
            key={track.title}
            title={track.title}
            artist={track.artist}
            length={track.length}
            genre={track.genre}
            imageSlot={<img src={track.coverImage.src} alt={track.coverImage.alt} />}
            favoriteButtonSlot={
              <TrackCard.FavoriteButton icon={track.isFavorite ? "FeatherHeartOff" : "FeatherHeart"} />
            }
          />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default FavoriteTracksPage
```

</CodeGroup>

Now, the page is dynamic and will render out different tracks depending on the `favoriteTracks` array.

The great thing about this approach is that we can sync changes to the `<TrackCard />` component from Subframe without breaking our application's business logic.
However, there's no way to sync changes to the page from Subframe, so if we make greater changes to the page, we either need to copy/paste the code again and add our logic, or manually edit the page to reflect the changes we made in Subframe.
