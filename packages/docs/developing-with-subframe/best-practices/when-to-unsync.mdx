<Warning>
    Unsyncing your components is meant to be a last resort when you _really_ need to make changes to a component that you can't do otherwise. It's an escape hatch if something about our generated code is preventing you from making the changes you need. If that's the case, [let us know!](https://join.slack.com/t/subframecommunity/shared_invite/zt-2gcv0nlow-qO_3pM3ZfNVGXZTWHVfwVw)
</Warning>

If you're trying to add business logic to a component, please follow our guide on [adding business logic](/developing-with-subframe/basics/adding-business-logic) first.

We always recommend wrapping your Subframe components in your own components. This way, you can make changes to the component without having to unsync it.

If you've already tried that and still need to unsync a component, you can add the following code to the top of your Subframe component file:

```tsx
// @subframe/sync-disable
```

This will prevent the changes in your component from being overwritten the next time you sync your components.
