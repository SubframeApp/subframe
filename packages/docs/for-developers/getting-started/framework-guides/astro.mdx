If you just want to get setup with Astro and Subframe quickly, you can follow the [quickstart guide](/for-developers/getting-started/quickstart). If you want to set up Subframe in your Astro app manually, you can follow the steps below.

<Note>
    This guide assumes that you already have React and Tailwind set up in your Astro app. If you don't, please follow the [Astro guide for scaffolding your project](https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/#install-from-the-cli-wizard), [the Astro guide for installing the React integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/react/) and the [TailwindCSS guide for setting up Tailwind in your Astro app using PostCSS](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss).
</Note>

## Initialize Subframe

To be able to sync our components within our Astro app and use them, we will need to initialize the project and configure it to be able to style Subframe.

The easiest way of doing so is the Subframe CLI, which will initialize the project for you and set up some necessary configurations.


<Steps>
    <Step title="Run the Subframe CLI">
        The following command will set up Subframe in your project.

        <CodeGroup>
            ```bash npm
            npx @subframe/cli@latest init
            ```
            ```bash yarn
            yarn @subframe/cli@latest init
            ```
            ```bash pnpm
            pnpm exec @subframe/cli@latest init
            ```
            ```bash bun
            bunx @subframe/cli@latest init
            ```
        </CodeGroup>

        <Steps>
            <Step title="Authenticate">
                Depending on whether you've used the Subframe CLI before, you'll be asked to authenticate when initializing your project. Simply follow the instructions in the terminal to authenticate.
            </Step>
            <Step title="Configure Subframe components directory">
                In most cases, you will want your Subframe components to be synced to `./src` in your project. This will result in your components being synced to `src/subframe` in your project's codebase. If you want to sync your components to a different directory, you can specify so now.
            </Step>
            <Step title="Configure import alias">
                Next, the CLI will set up an import alias for `@/subframe` for you. You can define what kind of alias you prefer here. Afterwards, the CLi will ask if you would like to add an alias to `tsconfig.json`. Since Astro will not directly play nicely with this, you can press `n` here. We'll fix this later.
            </Step>
            <Step title="Install dependencies">
                The CLI will ask if it should install dependencies for you. 
            </Step>
            <Step title="Configure Tailwind">
                Finally, the CLI will ask if it should configure your Tailwind config. Press `y` to confirm. This will add the necessary configurations to your Tailwind config. It should now look like this:
            </Step>
        </Steps>

        ```javascript tailwind.config.js {5, 12}
        /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
        export default {
            content: [
                "./index.html",
                "./src/subframe/**/*.{tsx,ts,js,jsx}" 
            ],
            theme: {
                extend: {},
            },
            plugins: [],
            presets: [
                require("./src/subframe/tailwind.config.js")
            ]
        };
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure Astro to use import aliases">
        Now configure your import alias in `tsconfig.json`.

        ```json tsconfig.json {3-8}
        {
            "compilerOptions": {
                "baseUrl": "./",
                "paths": {
                    "@/*": [
                        "./src/*"
                    ]
                },
                "tsBuildInfoFile": "./node_modules/.tmp/tsconfig.app.tsbuildinfo",
                "target": "ES2020",
                "useDefineForClassFields": true,
                "lib": ["ES2020", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"],
                "module": "ESNext",
                "skipLibCheck": true,

                /* Bundler mode */
                "moduleResolution": "bundler",
                "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,
                "isolatedModules": true,
                "moduleDetection": "force",
                "noEmit": true,
                "jsx": "react-jsx",

                /* Linting */
                "strict": true,
                "noUnusedLocals": true,
                "noUnusedParameters": true,
                "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
                "noUncheckedSideEffectImports": true+
            },
            "include": ["src"]
        }
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

You now have Subframe set up to use in your Astro app. You can now go ahead and sync your components to use them in your project.
