## Importing Subframe components in code

After syncing the components to your repository, you can use a Subframe component within your code, you can import it directly from your directory. For example, using the default alias of `@/ui/*`:

```tsx src/App.tsx {1, 5-10}
import { Alert } from '@/ui/components/Alert';

function App() {
    return (
        <Alert
            variant="neutral"
            icon="FeatherInfo"
            title="A great title for an alert"
            description="Describe what's happening in more detail."
        /> 
    )
}

export default App
```

## Viewing docs for a component

Subframe gives you a customizable design system that's exported as React code. You can add business logic to any exported Subframe component. To understand the React props available for a component, view its documentation.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Open Subframe and click on the Components tab in the top nav." />
    <Step title="Click on the component you want either in the left sidebar or in the middle" />
    <Step title="You should now see documentation for the React props, source code, and interactive examples." />
