title: Export to Lovable
---

Subframe generates React code for your designs which you can export directly to [Lovable](/export-to-lovable), [Bolt](/export-to-bolt), [Replit](/export-to-replit), or [Cursor](/export-to-cursor) to speed up development. 

Lovable offers a bit less code flexibility than some of their competitors, so we leverage their Github integration to set up Subframe.

### Start your Lovable project

1. In [Lovable](https://lovable.dev), start a new project using this prompt: "A simple hello world app using react, typescript, and tailwind".
2. [Connect](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration) your Lovable project to Github.

3. Make sure you [install fonts](/fonts).
4. Commit your changes and push them up to Github.
