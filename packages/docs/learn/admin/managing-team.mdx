Invite collaborators and manage roles and permissions in **Settings > Team**. Team members can access all projects within the team.

## Multiple teams

You can create and join multiple teams from a single Subframe account. Each team has its own projects, billing plan, and team members.

#### Creating a new team

1. Click the team dropdown in the top navigation
2. Select **New team**
3. Name your team and click **Create**

#### Switching teams

Click the team dropdown and select a team to switch. The dropdown shows a badge with each team's active plan.

Use multiple teams to:

- Separate work from personal projects
- Work with different clients
- Organize large organizations into smaller workspaces

If you sign up for Subframe using a domain tied to an existing team, you'll be prompted to join the team when you first log in.

  transfer with you.

## Remove a member
