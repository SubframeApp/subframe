Auth tokens let team members authenticate the Subframe CLI and MCP server with their accounts.

## Create a token

You can create a personal token for yourself at [app.subframe.com/cli/auth](https://app.subframe.com/cli/auth).

1. Go to **Settings > Access Tokens**
2. Click **New**
3. Copy the token from the dialog

Tokens are shown once. Store them securely.

<Note>Only Admins and Editors can create tokens. Viewers don't have CLI or code export access.</Note>

## Delete a token

In **Settings > Access Tokens**, click **⋯ > Delete** next to the token.

When removing team members, set their role to Inactive. Their tokens stop working immediately.
