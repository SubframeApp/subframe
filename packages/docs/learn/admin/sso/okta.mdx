  <Step title="Fill out SAML settings">
    These settings let Subframe use SAML 2.0 properly with your Okta application. Make sure you enter this information exactly as shown in this table and screenshot.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill out attribute settings">
    Attribute Statements allow Subframe to get information about your Okta users on each login.

    A `email` to `user.email` **statement is required**. Other mappings shown below are optional and configurable depending on your Okta setup. If in doubt, replicate the same config in the screenshot below.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain IdP metadata URL">
    Subframe needs to finalize enabling single sign-on with your Okta application.

    After you finalize the creation of your Subframe Application in Okta copy the Metadata URL and send it to your Subframe contact. If you're not sure who to send this to or need further assistance, contact [support@subframe.com](mailto:support@subframe.com).

    The Metadata URL usually has this structure: `https://<okta-org>.okta.com/apps/<app-id>/sso/saml/metadata`

    ![Sign On settings page showing Metadata URL location](/images/sso/okta/step-6.png)

  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for confirmation">
    Once you’ve configured the Okta app as describe above, send the Metadata URL to your support contact at Subframe.

    Wait for confirmation that this information has successfully been added to Subframe. It usually takes us less than 1 business day to configure this for your team.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Test single sign-on">
    Once you’ve received confirmation from your support contact at Subframe that SSO setup has been completed, you can ask some of your users to sign in with SSO via their Okta account.

    All they need to do is enter their work email address when they choose to sign in with SSO.

    If sign in is not working correctly, reach out to your support contact at Subframe for further guidance.
