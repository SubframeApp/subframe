## Upgrade to Pro

1. Go to **Settings > Billing**
2. Click **Upgrade**
3. Complete checkout in Stripe

Pro features activate immediately. Cost is calculated based on current Editors and Admins.

## Manage subscription

Go to **Settings > Billing** and click **Stripe portal** to:

- Update payment method
- View invoices
- Cancel subscription

Only Admins can access billing settings.

## Cancel or downgrade

Cancel your plan from the Stripe portal. Pro access continues until the billing period ends.

When downgrading to Free, all your existing projects, pages, and components are retained, but you won't be able to add new pages if over the Free plan limit.

## Billing changes

Adding or removing Editors/Admins updates your next invoice automatically. You're not charged immediately for new seats.
