Annotations let you add implementation notes to your design. They are used by prototype mode to instruct AI how your designs should behave.

## Adding annotations

1. Click **Annotate** in navbar
2. Click on an element in canvas
3. Type the annotation
4. Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> to save

You should see blue dots on elements for each annotation.

## Exporting to code

Annotations are also useful for documenting your design for handoff. Any annotation will be exported as comments in code:
