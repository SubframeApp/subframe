title: Prototype with AI
description: Create interactive prototypes with AI-powered code generation.

Prototypes let you build real web apps from your page designs, synced with your design system. They are created from screens in a [flow](/learn/flows/flows) by chatting and adding annotations.

## Creating a new prototype

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/prototype-mode/prototype-empty-state.png" alt="Screen to create new prototype" />
</Frame>

1. Create a new [flow](/learn/flows/flows)
2. Design your screens in design mode
3. Add [annotations](/learn/prototype-mode/annotations) describing functionality
4. Click **Prototype** in navbar
5. Type your first message in chat, then click **Send**

AI may take a few minutes to create a prototype and will preview it when finished.

## Iterating on prototypes

There are two ways to iterate on your prototype:

- **Chat** — Use prototype chat to add features, fix bugs, or refine interactions
- **Design updates** — Make changes in design mode, then apply them to your prototype

#### Chat

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/prototype-mode/chat-bar.png" alt="Chat bar in prototype mode" />
</Frame>

1. Open prototype
2. Type your prompt in the chat input
3. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to send

#### Making design updates

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/prototype-mode/apply-updates.png" alt="Apply design updates from chat bar" />
</Frame>

1. Make design changes or update annoations
2. Navigate to prototype mode
3. Click **Apply** in the chat bar

AI will update the code to match your new design.

<Warning>Design changes don't sync from prototype back to pages.</Warning>

#### Getting unstuck

If your prototype isn't working as expected, you have two options:

- **Start over** — Click **Start over** in the chat bar to regenerate a prototype from scratch using your current annotations
- **Revert to previous version** — Find a version in your conversation and click on <Icon icon="undo-2" size={16} /> to revert to that version

## Viewing code

1. Open prototype mode
2. Find version you want to inspect, click on <Icon icon="code" size={16} />
3. You should now see the code

## Downloading code

1. Open prototype mode
2. Find version you want to export, click on <Icon icon="code" size={16} />
3. Top-right, click on **Download** <Icon icon="download" size={16} />

This will download your prototype code as a Vite app in a zip file.

## Sharing prototypes

1. Click **Share** in navbar
2. Toggle on **Share link to latest prototype**
3. Copy and paste the generated link

## Best practices for design

- Create a new screen for each page (including dialogs) and states (e.g. loading, empty state, selected tabs)
- Subframe prototyping is meant for smaller prototypes. Avoid prototypes larger than 6+ designed screens—it will get slow
- If you need to create larger prototypes, try [exporting to code](/installation) and using Cursor or Claude Code

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I get designs out of my prototype?">

Not yet. To keep your designs in sync with your prototype, we recommend using chat and annotations for updating functionality, and applying changes from design mode for updating designs.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I add a dialog?">

1. Create two screens: one with the button, one with the dialog open
2. Add an [annotation](/learn/prototype-mode/annotations) on the button to open the dialog on click
