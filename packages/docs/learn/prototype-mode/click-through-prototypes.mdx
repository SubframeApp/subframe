Click-through prototypes let you connect two pages together based on clicks. When in preview mode, clicking on a linked element navigates to the connected page.

## Linking pages

1. Select an element
2. In inspector, click **Link to page** > <Icon icon="plus" size={16} />
3. Select the page you want to navigate to

When in [preview mode](/learn/design-mode/preview), clicking on that element will now navigate to that page.

Click-through prototypes are only used for connecting pages together via clicks. For more advanced features like form handling, state management, and dynamic interactions, use [Prototype with AI](/learn/prototype-mode/overview).
