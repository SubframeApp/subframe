## Import alias

Set the path prefix used for component imports in generated code.

**Default:** `@/ui/components`

This determines how import statements appear in your exported code:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/ui/components/Button"
```

Change this to match your project's directory structure and TypeScript path aliases.

## Company context

Provide context to help AI generate designs that are more relevant to your product.

#### Company name

Your company or product name. AI uses this to personalize generated content and copy.

#### Description

Describe your company, product, and design preferences. This helps AI understand:

- What your product does
- Your target audience
- Tone and style preferences
- Any specific design guidelines

<Tip>The more context you provide, the better AI can tailor designs to your brand and product.</Tip>

## Icon imports

Choose how icons are imported in generated code.

#### Import as component

Icons are imported as React components:

```tsx
import { FeatherIcon } from "@/ui/components/FeatherIcon"
```

```tsx
<FeatherIcon name="check" />
```

#### Import as string

Icons are referenced by name as strings:

```tsx
import { Icon } from "@/ui/components/Icon"
```

```tsx
<Icon name="FeatherCheck" />
```

<Info>
  If your project has uploaded custom icons, you must use "Import as component". The string option is disabled when
  custom icons are present.
