All team members have access to your designs by default. The easiest way to share your designs is to share the direct link.

## Invite teammates

1. Click **Share** in the navbar
2. Type your teammates email in the input field
3. Press **Invite**. They will receive an email to view the designs, and an invite to join your team if they're not already a member.

## Share public view-only link

1. Click **Share** in the navbar
2. Click the toggle to enable public sharing
3. Copy the link that appears

Anyone with the link can view the design, even if they're not part of your team or logged in.
