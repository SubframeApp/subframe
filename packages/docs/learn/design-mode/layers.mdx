## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why is there a lock icon next to some layers?">
    Some layers are locked because they're essential for the page or component to function. For example, most page layouts have a "children" layer that cannot be deleted because it's needed to render the actual page contents.
