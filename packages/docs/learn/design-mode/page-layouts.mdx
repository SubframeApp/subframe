description: Apply navigation and modal layouts to your pages.

Page layouts wrap your page content with headers, sidebars, modals, or drawers. Choose a layout type in the page settings to control how your page appears in the application.

## Layout types

**Default** - Standard page with optional header and sidebar navigation. Use this for most pages in your app.

**Dialog** - Page displays as a centered modal dialog with a backdrop. The dialog can be closed by clicking the backdrop or a close button.

**Drawer** - Page slides in from the side as a drawer/sheet. Useful for forms, filters, or secondary navigation.

**No Layout** - Blank canvas with no wrapper. Gives you full control over the page structure. Use this for landing pages or custom layouts.

## Setting the page layout

1. Click the page settings icon in the top toolbar
2. Find the **Layout** dropdown
3. Select your layout type
4. The canvas updates to preview your choice

## Default layout

The Default layout includes slots for:

- **Header** - Top navigation with logo, links, and actions
- **Sidebar** - Side navigation or contextual content
- **Footer** - Bottom content and links

Add navigation components to these slots in the page settings. These components persist across all pages using the Default layout.

**Configure the default layout:**

1. Select the Default layout type
2. Click **Edit Layout** in page settings
3. Drag header, sidebar, or footer components into the layout slots
4. Configure each component's props

## Dialog layout

Dialog layouts center your page content in a modal with a backdrop.

**Dialog properties:**

- **Width** - Set the dialog width (small, medium, large, or custom)
- **Close on backdrop click** - Whether clicking the backdrop dismisses the dialog
- **Show close button** - Display an X button to close

Use Dialog layouts for confirmation screens, settings panels, or focused workflows.

## Drawer layout

Drawer layouts slide your page in from the side.

**Drawer properties:**

- **Position** - Left or right side of the screen
- **Width** - Set the drawer width
- **Close on backdrop click** - Whether clicking outside closes the drawer

Use Drawer layouts for filters, navigation menus, or supplementary content.

## No Layout

No Layout gives you a blank canvas. Build custom layouts with Stacks and containers without any wrapper.

Use this for:

- Landing pages with custom navigation
- Marketing pages with unique layouts
- Pages that need full control over the viewport

## Layout inheritance

All pages in a project can share the same layout configuration. When you update the Default layout's header or sidebar, the changes apply to all pages using that layout.

Create custom layout variants by defining different header or sidebar components and swapping them in page settings.
