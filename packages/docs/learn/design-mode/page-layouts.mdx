Page layouts are reusable templates that wrap your page content with headers, sidebars, modals, or drawers.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/design-mode/page-layouts.png" alt="Page layouts showing the page settings dropdown" />
</Frame>

All layouts have a slot property called `children` that cannot be deleted. Any page contents will be rendered inside this slot.

## Applying a layout

1. Open a page in the editor.
2. Ensure you don't have any elements selected. You should see layouts in the right sidebar.
3. Click on the layout to apply it to the page.

## Creating a new layout

2. Ensure you don't have any elements selected. You should see layouts in the right sidebar.
3. Click on the **+** new layout button.
