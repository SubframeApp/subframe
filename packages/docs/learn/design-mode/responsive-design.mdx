description: Design for mobile and desktop breakpoints.

Subframe has two breakpoints:

- **Default** — Desktop and tablet (768px and above)
- **Mobile** <Icon icon="smartphone" size={16} /> — 767px and below

## Switching breakpoints

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/editor/editor-breakpoints.png" alt="Breakpoint selector showing desktop and mobile views" />
</Frame>

Click the device selector in the top toolbar to switch between default and mobile views.

## Creating mobile overrides

You can add mobile overrides to both pages and components.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/design-mode/overrides.png" alt="Inspector showing mobile override with pink dot indicator" />
</Frame>

1. Switch to mobile view <Icon icon="smartphone" size={16} />
2. Select an element
3. Modify any property in the Inspector
4. An override indicator (pink dot) appears next to the property

To remove a mobile override, click the pink dot to reset to the default value.

## Code export

When there is a mobile override, the exported code uses a `mobile:` prefix in Tailwind, which adds a media query:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```tsx
<div className="flex mobile:flex-col">
  {/* Horizontal on desktop, vertical on mobile */}
</div>
```

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can't I override this property?">
    If you don't see a pink dot, no mobile override is being set.
    {/* prettier-ignore */}
    Mobile overrides only work for styles that translate to CSS, so some properties without a CSS equivalent cannot have
    a mobile override.
