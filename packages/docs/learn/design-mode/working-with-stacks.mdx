title: Working with stacks
description: Master stack-based layouts with direction, spacing, and alignment.

Stacks are the most fundamental building block in Subframe. They're essential for layout—equivalent to flexbox in code and auto-layouts in Figma.

## Grouping elements

To wrap elements in a stack:

1. Select one or more elements
2. Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd>, or right-click to open [quick actions](/learn/design-mode/quick-actions) and select **Wrap in Stack**

## Updating layout and alignment

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/design-mode/layout-inspector.png"
    alt="Layout inspector showing the layout / alignment properties"
  />
</Frame>

Select a stack to configure its layout in the Inspector:

- **Direction** — Vertical, horizontal, or wrap
- **Gap** — Space between children (pixels or "fill" for space-between)
- **Alignment** — How children are positioned (start, center, end, space between, space around, stretch)

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I move an element to the opposite side?">
    First, ensure your parent stack has enough space (set width / height to fill).

    **Solution 1 — Make the sibling fill (recommended)**
    1. Select the sibling element
    2. Set width / height to **Fill**

    The sibling expands and pushes the other element to the opposite side.

    **Solution 2 — Set gap to fill**
    1. Select the parent stack
    2. Set gap to **Fill**

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I align a single child differently from its siblings?">
    Alignment applies to all children in a stack, so you need to wrap the element in its own stack.

    1. Wrap the element in its own stack
    2. Set the wrapper stack's alignment as needed
    3. You may need to make the wrapper stack

    The wrapper stack lets you control that element's alignment independently.
