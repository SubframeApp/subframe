  <Accordion title="Can I import my existing component library?">
    If you have existing components in your codebase already, you can import them into Subframe.

    Note: This feature is in a limited beta and not available for everyone. If you're interested in early access, reach out to support@subframe.com

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does Subframe integrate with AI code tools?">
    You can use the Subframe's [MCP server](/guides/mcp-server) to build with tools like Cursor or Claude Code.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I add logic to my Subframe components?">
    We recommend wrapping your Subframe components in your own logical components. This way, you can make changes to the component without having to unsync them. For more information, see our guide on [syncing components](/concepts/syncing-components).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why do I not see my pages in my codebase after I sync?">
    Pages often require refactoring and additional business logic after export. For that reason, pages are never synced via CLI and always copy / pasted. For more information, see our guide on [exporting pages](/concepts/exporting-pages).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will my code keep working if I cancel my subscription?">
    All of your code is synced to your codebase and yours to keep. The libraries that Subframe components depend on are [open source](https://github.com/SubframeApp/subframe) and will remain available should you cancel your subscription or if Subframe were to shut down.

  <Accordion title="Can I import my designs from Figma?">
    You can copy your Figma pages as PNGs and ask Subframe AI to recreate the design in Subframe.
