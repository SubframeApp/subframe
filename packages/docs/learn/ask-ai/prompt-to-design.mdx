You can prompt AI to generate page designs, edit your existing designs, or update your theme.

- **Design new pages** — Generate multiple variations of page designs
- **Edit your page directly** — Make targeted changes to your current page
- **Update your theme** — Modify colors, fonts, and tokens project-wide
- **Answer questions** — Search Subframe docs for help with features and development workflows

Ask AI is for creating and updating designs. For adding interactivity and state, use [Prototype mode](/learn/prototype-mode/overview).

## Getting started

1. Click **Ask AI** in the mode switcher (top-right) of the page editor or press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> and select **Mode > Ask AI**
2. Type a prompt and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or click the send button
3. Ask AI will create a new conversation and responds to your prompt

/>

Our AI will choose how to respond based on your prompt:

- **Variations** — For new designs, creative exploration, or prompts requiring new components. Ask AI will generate 1-4 variations for you to choose from.
- **Direct edits** — For simple changes to existing elements like colors, text, or layout tweaks

## Apply designs

After generations finish streaming, click each thumbnail to open a preview.

</Frame>

From the preview, you can:

- **Apply design** — Replace your current page
- **Save as new page** — Create a new page with this design
- **Ask follow-up** — Refine with another prompt

You can even **mix and match elements** from different variations by dragging elements from the preview onto your canvas.

/>

After generating, send follow-up prompts or switch to [design mode](/learn/design-mode/layers) for manual edits. Each follow-up can reference the current page and previous generations.

## Conversation history

Recent conversations appear at the bottom of the Ask AI panel. Click **Show all history** to see older conversations grouped by date.

Your conversations persist across sessions and pages so you can reference past generations.

## Ask AI toolbar

Ask AI includes additional tools:

- **[Referencing pages](/learn/ask-ai/referencing-pages)** — Remix other pages as prompts for your design
- **[Upload image](/learn/ask-ai/image-to-design)** — Add reference images
- **[Import from Figma](/learn/ask-ai/image-to-design#import-from-figma)** — Import Figma designs using the image model
- **[Personalize AI](/learn/ask-ai/personalizing-ai)** — Configure project-wide context

You can also use [quick edits](/learn/ask-ai/making-quick-edits) to make targeted edits to specific elements using AI.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="AI is not applying changes where I want them">
Ask AI is great for generating new designs or making broad changes to your page. But for more targeted edits, you may want to use [quick edits](/learn/ask-ai/making-quick-edits).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I can't edit components">
  Ask AI mode only works with pages. To edit components, use [quick edit](/learn/ask-ai/making-quick-edits)—select an
  element inside the component, then right-click or press <kbd>/</kbd> to open [quick
  actions](/learn/design-mode/quick-actions) and select **Ask AI to edit...**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I undo changes?">
  Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> to undo. Subframe maintains full undo history, so you can step back through
  multiple changes. You can also use [Version history](/learn/projects/version-history) to restore a previous state.
