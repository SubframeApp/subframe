Reference other pages as context when generating new designs.

## Add pages as context

By default, Ask AI references your current page. To add more context:

1. Click the **Remix** button in the chat bar (shown as **@ Current page**)
2. Select additional pages from the list
3. Type your prompt and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

Ask AI generates variations that reference the design from your selected pages.

## Example prompts

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Create variations">
Generate alternative versions of an existing page for A/B testing or exploration.

> > "Create a version with the pricing front and center"

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Maintain consistency">
