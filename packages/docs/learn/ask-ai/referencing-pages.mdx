By default, Ask AI references your current page. But you can also add other pages as explicit references, which is useful for remixing existing designs:

1. Click the references button in the chat bar (shown as **@ Current page**)
2. Select pages to reference from the list
3. Type your prompt and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

Ask AI generates variations that reference the design from your selected pages.
