title: Personalizing AI
---

Subframe is the only AI design tool that learns from your designs, allowing you to train and personalize the AI for each project.

## Project context

Add a system prompt about your project (e.g. company description, tone preferences, design guidelines) to help AI generate designs that are more relevant to your product.

1. Click the **gear icon** <Icon icon="settings" size={16} /> in the Ask AI chat bar
2. Enter your **Company name**
3. Enter your **project description** —describe your company, product, and design preferences
4. Click **Save** to apply your settings

Alternatively you can change this in your [project settings](/learn/projects/managing-projects).

## Referencing existing designs

Ask AI automatically references your existing designs when generating new ones. Three things influence AI in your project:

- **Design system**: Your components and theme keep everything on brand
- **Your pages**:AI learns from pages you design
- **Snippets**: Pre-built compositions like headers and nav bars that AI references
