<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Insert examples">
    - "Add a cancel button" — Inserts a button next to the current element - "Insert an email field" — Adds a field with
    appropriate styling - "Add a subtitle" — Inserts text with correct hierarchy
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips

- **Be specific** — "Make text 24px" works better than "make it bigger"
- **One change at a time** — Multiple edits in one prompt can be unpredictable
- **Reference your theme** — AI understands "brand color", "heading font", "primary button"
