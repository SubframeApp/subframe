Subframe has four elements that form the foundation of all designs:

- **Stack** — Arranges child elements using flexbox. Set direction (vertical, horizontal, wrap), gap, alignment, and padding.
- **Text** — Creates headings, paragraphs, and labels. Double-click to edit content.
- **Icon** — Displays SVG icons from Feather Icons, Lucide, Font Awesome, Heroicons, or custom uploads.
- **Image** — Displays pictures from URLs or uploaded files.

**Components** are reusable UI elements built from these four elements. See [Components](/learn/components/creating-components) to learn more.
