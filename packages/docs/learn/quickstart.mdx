## Create your first project

1. Sign up at [subframe.com](https://subframe.com) to create your first project.
2. Configure your theme with quick presets or customize later in the Theme page.
3. Select a default navigation style for your app.

After onboarding, you will see a blank project with the base component library set up.

## Design your first page

You can create a new page with AI, select a template, or start from scratch.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prompt with AI">

    <img src="/images/quickstart/quickstart-prompt-ai.png" alt="Design with AI prompt dialog" />

    Ask AI generates multiple design variations using your theme and components.

    1. Go to [subframe.com/design/new](https://app.subframe.com/design/new) to open the new page dialog.
    2. Type a prompt for the page you want to design.
    3. Submit your prompt to open the page editor and wait for designs to generate.
    4. Select a variation to preview in the Ask AI panel.
    5. Click **Apply design** to add it to the current page.

    <Tip>Mix and match elements from different variations by dragging to the page from the preview.</Tip>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit in Design Mode">

    <img src="/images/quickstart/quickstart-design-mode.png" alt="Page editor in design mode" />

    Switch to Design Mode to refine your page in the responsive page editor.

    - Drag-and-drop elements on the page to rearrange.
    - Select an element and click the **+** Insert buttons to add new elements inline.
    - Edit styles and properties in the Inspector panel on the right.
    - Right-click or press <kbd>/</kbd> for contextual edits to a selected element.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Set up your codebase

Next, we'll create a new project using the Subframe Vite starter kit to implement your design. Open a new folder on your computer using Cursor or your favorite IDE.

<Steps>
<Step title="Setup your project">

See [Installation](/learn/installation) for detailed instructions on setting up Subframe in a new or existing project.

</Step>
  <Step title="Install the MCP server">

    <img src="/images/quickstart/quickstart-setup-mcp.png" alt="Installation instructions for Cursor and Claude MCP server" />

    In the page editor, open **Code** > **Installation** to view Cursor or Claude Code instructions specific to your project.

    Go to https://app.subframe.com/cli/auth to generate your auth token.

    <Info>To learn more about the MCP server and its capabilities, see [MCP Server](/guides/mcp-server).</Info>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize Subframe">

    <img src="/images/quickstart/quickstart-cursor-init.png" alt="Cursor project with Subframe installation prompt" />

    Copy the installation prompt in **Code** > **Installation** for Cursor or Claude Code and run it in your project's root folder.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Prompt to implement your design">

    <img src="/images/quickstart/quickstart-mcp-link.png" alt="Code mode inspect view with link for MCP server" />

    Switch to **Code** > **Inspect** and copy the MCP link from Subframe to add to your prompt:

    > "Implement the design from this Subframe page [YOUR_PAGE_MCP_LINK]"

    AI fetches the code via MCP and adds business logic.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start your development server">
If you created a new project, you can start your development server with:

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open `localhost:3000`—your page renders exactly as designed.

  </Step>
</Steps>

You're all set! Your Subframe project is now connected and ready for development.
