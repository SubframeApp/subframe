Flows are folders for grouping related pages together. They're also used to create [prototypes](/learn/prototype-mode/overview).

## Creating a flow

1. Navigate to **Pages** in navbar
2. Click **New flow** in the bottom of the left sidebar

## Adding pages to a flow

1. Click <Icon icon="ellipsis" size={16} /> on a page
2. Select **Move to...** > select the flow (or **New flow...**)

You can also drag pages directly into a flow from the pages list when editing a page.

<Accordion title="When should I create a new flow vs use an existing one?">
