Snippets are reusable designs that can be inserted anywhere. They are usually composed designs—similar to molecules and organisms in an atomic design system.

Unlike components, changes to snippets will not affect anywhere that uses them.

## Creating a snippet

1. Right-click or press <kbd>/</kbd> to open [quick actions](/learn/design-mode/quick-actions)
2. Select **Save as snippet**
3. Preview your snippet and give it a name
4. Click **Create**

## Inserting snippets

There are two ways to insert snippets:

- In the left panel, go to **Insert** > **Snippets**
- Search for the snippet using the [quick insert](/learn/design-mode/adding-elements) <Icon icon="plus" size={16} /> menu

See [adding elements](/learn/design-mode/adding-elements) for more info.

## Managing snippets

Access your snippets at any time from **[Snippets](https://app.subframe.com/library?component=snippets)** in the left panel. You can edit or delete snippets from here.
