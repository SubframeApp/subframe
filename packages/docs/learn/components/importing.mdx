<Note>
  This feature is in development. Contact [support@subframe.com](mailto:support@subframe.com) for early access.
</Note>

In the meantime, you can recreate your design system in Subframe. It's usually faster than you think:

- [Import your theme](/learn/theme/importing-tokens) first
- [Create a component](/learn/components/overview) for each existing React component
- Use [AI quick edits](/learn/ask-ai/making-quick-edits) to refine the design
