description: Build custom components visually for your design system.

Build production UI component libraries visually using React + Tailwind CSS. Every Subframe project starts with base components built using [subframe/core](https://github.com/SubframeApp/subframe) – an open-source wrapper around [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com/).

## Design-to-code workflow

Designers maintain the component library in Subframe. Engineers sync components to production with `npx @subframe/cli sync`. Components export as TypeScript React code with Tailwind styling. Changes flow one way: from Subframe to code.

## Base vs custom components

**Base components** include built-in interactivity and accessibility:

- **Select, Dropdown Menu** — State management for open/closed, selection
- **Accordion** — Collapsible state, keyboard navigation
- **Checkbox, Switch, Radio Group** — Checked state, form integration
- **Slider** — Range value handling, thumb positioning
- **Toggle Group** — Selection state management

**Custom components** are visual-only without built-in logic. Add business logic in your codebase after syncing—event handlers, API calls, state management.

<Note>
  Ask AI doesn't create or update components directly. Create components manually from scratch, from a page, or by
  remixing existing components.
</Note>

## Creating components

### From the Components page

1. Navigate to **Components** tab (top nav)
2. Click **+ New component**
3. Choose creation method:
   - **Remix** — Duplicate an existing base component as starting point
   - **New blank component** — Start from scratch
4. Name your component (use PascalCase: ProductCard, UserAvatar)

Remixing is useful for creating variations of base components while preserving their structure and properties.

### From an existing design

Create components directly from elements on a page:

1. Right-click an element or press <kbd>/</kbd> → **Create component**
2. Name your component
3. Review AI-suggested properties—edit these later in the component editor
4. Click **Create**

Subframe analyzes your selection and suggests properties based on detected content: Text, Icon, Image, Slot. Toggle suggestions on or off and rename as needed.

## Adding properties

Properties make your component configurable. Select an element and click **+ Add property** in the Inspector.

**Property types:**

- **Text** — Editable text content (titles, labels)
- **Boolean** — True/false toggle
- **Variant** — Enum choices (size, style options)
- **Icon** — Icon selection from libraries
- **Image** — Image URLs or uploads
- **Number** — Numeric values
- **Slot** — Flexible areas for React children

Each property exports as a TypeScript prop with full type safety.

## Variants

Variants are pre-configured versions using enum properties. Common patterns:

**Size variants** — Create "size" enum with small, medium, large. Adjust padding, font size, spacing per option.

**Style variants** — Create "variant" enum with primary, secondary, destructive. Change colors and styling per option.

To style variants: select the enum value from dropdown, apply styles—those styles only apply to that variant.

## States

States define appearance during interaction. Add from the States dropdown:

- **Hover** — Mouse over (`:hover`)
- **Pressed** — Active/clicked (`:active`)
- **Focused** — Keyboard focus (`:focus-visible`)

## Subcomponents

Subcomponents are child components scoped to a parent. They export as compound components in code (e.g., `Card.Header`, `Card.Footer`).

### Creating subcomponents

1. Open your component in the editor
2. Click the component name dropdown in the left panel
3. Click **+ Add subcomponent**
4. Name your subcomponent
5. Build the subcomponent structure

### Common examples

- **Card** with Header, Body, Footer subcomponents
- **List** with Item subcomponent
- **Table** with Header, Row, Cell subcomponents
- **Accordion** with Trigger, Content subcomponents

### Using in code

Subcomponents export as properties on the parent component:

```tsx
<Card>
  <Card.Header>Title</Card.Header>
  <Card.Body>Content here</Card.Body>
  <Card.Footer>
    <Button>Action</Button>
  </Card.Footer>
</Card>
```

Subcomponents can be reordered via drag-and-drop in the component dropdown. Some base component subcomponents cannot be deleted as they're required for functionality.

## Slots

Slots accept React children for component composition. Create slots by selecting a Stack, right-clicking → **Add slot**, and naming it (e.g., "actions", "header").

For guidance on when to use slots vs props, see [Props and slots](/components/props-and-slots).

## Previewing components

Preview your component in a sandbox to test properties and variants:

1. Click **Preview** in the top navigation
2. Adjust property values in the Inspector panel
3. Test different variant combinations
4. Check responsive behavior

The preview renders your component with live property controls. Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to exit preview mode.

## Saving and syncing

Components auto-save as you work. Saved components appear in the library under "Custom" for use in any page.

Sync to your codebase:

```bash
npx @subframe/cli sync --all
```

Components export as TypeScript React with full type safety:

```tsx ProductCard.tsx
import * as React from "react"

export interface ProductCardProps {
  title: string
  price: string
  size?: "small" | "medium" | "large"
  variant?: "default" | "featured"
}

export const ProductCard = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, ProductCardProps>(function ProductCard(
  { size = "medium", variant = "default", ...props },
  ref,
) {
  // Generated implementation
})
```

## Editing components

Edit any component—base or custom:

1. Go to **Components** tab
2. Select your component
3. Make changes in the editor
4. All instances update automatically

Or right-click any instance → **Edit component**.

Base components are fully customizable. Change colors, layouts, variants, spacing—all changes update instances across pages immediately.
