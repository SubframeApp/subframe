Subcomponents are child components scoped to a parent (also known as compound components). Use them to group related components together. In code, they are represented as properties of the parent component.

```tsx
<Card>
  <Card.Header>Title</Card.Header>
  <Card.Body>Content goes here</Card.Body>
  <Card.Footer>Actions</Card.Footer>
</Card>
```

In this example, `Card` is the parent component. `Header`, `Body`, and `Footer` are subcomponents.

## Creating subcomponents

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/components/subcomponent-menu.png" alt="Subcomponent panel when editing a component" />
</Frame>

1. Open your parent component
2. In the left panel, click on **Subcomponents** > <Icon icon="plus" size={16} />
