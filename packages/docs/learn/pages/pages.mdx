## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How do I design page states?">

For page states like loading, empty, and error states, we recommend creating a separate page for each state. You can easily duplicate the page for this. Organize the screens together with a [flow](/learn/flows/flows) and use [annotations](/learn/prototype-mode/annotations) to describe how the screens are connected during handoff.
