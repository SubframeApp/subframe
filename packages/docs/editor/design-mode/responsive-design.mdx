Subframe uses a desktop-first responsive design approach. Design for desktop, then add mobile-specific overrides for properties that need to change on smaller screens.

## Breakpoints

Subframe has two breakpoints:
- **Default** - Desktop and tablet (768px and above)
- **Mobile** - Phones (767px and below)

The default design applies to all screen sizes. Mobile overrides only apply when the viewport is 767px or narrower.

## Switching breakpoints

Click the device selector in the top toolbar to switch between default and mobile views. The canvas resizes to show how your design looks at each breakpoint.

The current breakpoint indicator shows which view you're in.

## Mobile overrides

Mobile overrides customize specific properties for mobile devices without changing the desktop design.

**Create an override:**
1. Switch to mobile view
2. Select an element
3. Modify any property in the Inspector
4. An override indicator appears next to the property

**Override indicator** - A blue dot shows when a property has a mobile override.

**Clear an override** - Click the override indicator to remove the mobile-specific value and use the default value.

## Properties that support overrides

Almost all properties support mobile overrides:

**Layout** - Width, height, padding, gap, direction, alignment

**Style** - Background, border, corner, shadow, opacity

**Typography** - Font size, line height, color, alignment

**Visibility** - Hide elements on mobile

**Spacing** - Adjust gaps and padding for smaller screens

## Common responsive patterns

**Horizontal to vertical layout** - Change a horizontal Stack to vertical:
1. Create a horizontal Stack on desktop
2. Switch to mobile
3. Override **Direction** to vertical

**Hide on mobile** - Remove elements that don't fit on small screens:
1. Select the element
2. Switch to mobile
3. Add a mobile override to hide it

**Reduce spacing** - Tighten gaps and padding for mobile:
1. Select a Stack
2. Switch to mobile
3. Override **Gap** and **Padding** to smaller values

**Adjust font sizes** - Make text smaller on mobile:
1. Select a Text element
2. Switch to mobile
3. Override **Size** to a smaller value

## Code export

Mobile overrides export using the `mobile:` prefix in Tailwind CSS:

```tsx
<div className="flex flex-row mobile:flex-col gap-6 mobile:gap-4">
  {/* Horizontal on desktop, vertical on mobile */}
  {/* 24px gap on desktop, 16px on mobile */}
</div>
```

The `mobile:` prefix generates a media query that applies styles when the viewport is 767px or narrower.

## Best practices

**Design desktop-first** - Start with the desktop layout, then adjust for mobile. This matches how Subframe generates CSS.

**Test frequently** - Toggle to mobile view regularly as you build. Don't wait until the end to check mobile.

**Touch targets** - Interactive elements should be at least 44x44px on mobile for easy tapping.

**Simplify layouts** - Mobile screens have less space. Hide secondary content, reduce columns, and streamline navigation.

**Consistent spacing** - Use Subframe's spacing scale (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32). Reduce by one step for mobile (e.g., 24px → 16px).
