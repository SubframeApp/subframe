title: Preview
description: Preview your designs and test interactions.
---

Preview mode shows how your design behaves outside the editor. Test responsive breakpoints, page navigation, and component interactions.

## Opening preview

Click the **Preview** button in the top toolbar or press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>. Your page opens in a new tab without editor UI.

Preview mode is fully interactive—buttons work, inputs accept text, and links navigate between pages.

## Testing responsive design

Resize the browser window or use browser dev tools to test different screen sizes. Your design adapts based on the mobile overrides you configured.

The mobile breakpoint activates at 767px and below.

## Sharing previews

Generate a public preview link to share your design with others:

1. Click **Share** in the top toolbar
2. Enable **Public preview link**
3. Copy the link

Anyone with the link can view and interact with your design. No Subframe account required.

Preview links stay active as long as the project exists. Disable the public link anytime in share settings.

## What preview shows

Preview displays your design exactly as it will appear when exported to code:
- All styling and layout
- Responsive behavior at different breakpoints
- Page layouts (headers, sidebars, modals, drawers)
- Component variants and states

Preview doesn't include:
- Business logic or API calls (add these when integrating with code)
- Custom JavaScript behaviors
- Backend data or authentication
