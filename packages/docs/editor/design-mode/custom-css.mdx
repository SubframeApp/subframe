title: Custom Tailwind CSS
description: Add custom Tailwind utility classes to elements.
---

Add custom Tailwind CSS classes to any element for fine-tuned styling beyond what the Inspector provides. This gives you full access to Tailwind's utility classes while keeping your design in Subframe.

## Adding custom classes

1. Select an element
2. Find the **Tailwind CSS** section in the Inspector (right sidebar)
3. Click to enable the input field
4. Type space-separated class names
5. Classes apply immediately to the element

**Example:**
```
px-4 py-2 hover:bg-blue-500 transition-all
```

## Removing custom classes

Click the trash icon next to the **Tailwind CSS** field to remove all custom classes from the element.

You can also edit the field to remove specific classes while keeping others.

## How custom classes work

Custom Tailwind classes apply alongside Subframe-generated styles. Subframe generates base styles, and your custom classes extend or override them.

**Subframe generates:**
```tsx
<div className="flex flex-col gap-4 p-6">
```

**You add custom classes:**
```tsx
<div className="flex flex-col gap-4 p-6 hover:shadow-lg transition-all">
```

## Supported Tailwind features

You can use any Tailwind utility class, including:

**Layout** - `container`, `aspect-square`, `overflow-hidden`

**Spacing** - `mx-auto`, `space-x-4`, `divide-y`

**Typography** - `font-mono`, `tracking-wide`, `leading-relaxed`

**Backgrounds** - `bg-gradient-to-r`, `from-blue-500`, `to-purple-600`

**Borders** - `border-dashed`, `divide-x`, `ring-2`

**Effects** - `shadow-xl`, `blur-sm`, `grayscale`

**Transitions** - `transition-all`, `duration-300`, `ease-in-out`

**Transforms** - `scale-105`, `rotate-45`, `translate-x-4`

**Hover/Focus states** - `hover:bg-blue-500`, `focus:ring-2`

**Responsive variants** - `mobile:hidden`, `md:flex`, `lg:grid-cols-3`

**Dark mode** - `dark:bg-gray-800`, `dark:text-white`

## Custom classes vs Inspector

**Use the Inspector for:**
- Standard styling (colors, spacing, sizing)
- Properties that need mobile overrides
- Visual editing with immediate feedback

**Use custom classes for:**
- Hover and focus states
- Transitions and animations
- Advanced Tailwind features (gradients, transforms, filters)
- One-off utility classes not in the Inspector

## Mobile overrides

Custom classes support the `mobile:` prefix for responsive styles:

```
hidden mobile:block mobile:text-sm
```

This hides the element on desktop but shows it on mobile with smaller text.

You can also create separate custom class overrides for mobile in the Inspector when viewing the mobile breakpoint.

## Tailwind documentation

Click the Tailwind icon next to the **Tailwind CSS** field to open the Tailwind CSS documentation in a new tab.

Use the docs to find utility class names and see examples.

## Actions menu integration

The Actions menu includes common Tailwind utilities:

Press <kbd>/</kbd> with an element selected and search for:
- **Overflow** - Adds `overflow-auto` or `overflow-hidden`
- **Scroll** - Adds `overflow-auto`
- Other utilities

These actions add classes to your existing custom classes automatically.

## Code export

Custom classes export exactly as you typed them:

```tsx
<div className="flex flex-col gap-4 hover:shadow-lg transition-all duration-300">
  {/* Your content */}
</div>
```

Your development environment must have Tailwind CSS configured with the same class names for styles to apply correctly.

## Best practices

**Use custom classes sparingly** - Rely on the Inspector for most styling. Custom classes are for edge cases and advanced features.

**Follow Tailwind conventions** - Use Tailwind's utility-first approach. Avoid writing custom CSS classes.

**Test in preview** - Check that your custom classes work as expected before exporting code.

**Document complex classes** - If you use many custom classes, add comments in your code after export to explain their purpose.

**Leverage responsive variants** - Use `mobile:`, `md:`, `lg:` prefixes for responsive behavior beyond Subframe's default breakpoints (requires Tailwind config).

## Limitations

Custom classes don't appear as editable properties in the Inspector. To modify them, return to the **Tailwind CSS** field and edit the text.

Subframe doesn't validate custom class names. Typos or invalid classes won't cause errors in the editor but won't work in your exported code.
