title: Working with stacks
description: Master stack-based layouts with direction, spacing, and alignment.
---

Stacks are the foundation of layouts in Subframe. A stack is a container that arranges children in a direction (vertical, horizontal, or wrap) with consistent spacing and alignment. This matches how modern web interfaces work—using flexbox instead of absolute positioning.

If you're familiar with auto-layout in Figma, stacks work the same way. Everything you design uses stacks to create responsive, production-ready layouts.

## Stack properties

Every stack has three core properties:

**Direction** — Vertical, horizontal, or wrap. Controls how children flow.

**Gap** — Space between children. Set to exact pixels or "fill" for space-between.

**Alignment** — How children align on main axis (start, center, end) and cross axis (start, center, end).

Configure these in the Inspector panel under Layout. Use keyboard shortcuts for faster workflow:
- <kbd>d</kbd> <kbd>v</kbd> — Vertical direction
- <kbd>d</kbd> <kbd>h</kbd> — Horizontal direction
- <kbd>d</kbd> <kbd>w</kbd> — Wrap direction

## Common use cases

### Moving elements to opposite sides

**Problem:** You need to push a button to the right side while keeping another element on the left.

**Two solutions:**

**Option 1: Set gap to fill**

Works well for two elements. The gap becomes flexible space that pushes elements apart.

1. Select the parent stack
2. Click **Layout** in Inspector
3. Click the "Fill" button next to Gap

This creates space-between alignment. Add a third element and it appears in the center—not ideal for most layouts.

**Option 2: Grow a sibling to fill (recommended)**

More flexible approach that works with any number of children.

1. Select the stack between the left element and right button
2. Set **Width** to **Fill** (<kbd>w</kbd> <kbd>f</kbd>)

The filled stack pushes the button to the right. Add more elements and they maintain position.

**Why this works:** The filled stack consumes available space, forcing siblings to the edges. This pattern is fundamental to stack-based layouts.

### Aligning children within a stack

**Problem:** You select an element and try to align it left, but nothing happens.

**Solution:** Select the parent stack, not the child.

Stack alignment settings apply to children, not the stack itself. To align elements:

1. Click the parent stack containing your elements
2. Use the **Alignment Picker** (9-cell grid) in Inspector
3. Click desired alignment position

The alignment picker shows all combinations of main axis and cross axis alignment. For vertical stacks:
- **Main axis** (vertical) — Top, center, bottom
- **Cross axis** (horizontal) — Left, center, right

For horizontal stacks, axes swap directions.

**Quick tip:** Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to select parent stack when child is selected.

### Growing elements to fill space

**Problem:** Your stack has extra space and you want an element to expand.

**Solution:** Set the element's width or height to fill.

1. Select the element
2. Press <kbd>w</kbd> <kbd>f</kbd> for width fill or <kbd>h</kbd> <kbd>f</kbd> for height fill
3. Element expands to consume available space

**Sizing options:**
- **Hug** (<kbd>w</kbd> <kbd>h</kbd> / <kbd>h</kbd> <kbd>h</kbd>) — Size to fit content
- **Fill** (<kbd>w</kbd> <kbd>f</kbd> / <kbd>h</kbd> <kbd>f</kbd>) — Expand to fill parent
- **Absolute** (<kbd>w</kbd> <kbd>a</kbd> / <kbd>h</kbd> <kbd>a</kbd>) — Explicit pixel size

### Adding elements between existing items

**Problem:** You need to insert an element between two existing elements without disrupting layout.

**Solution:** Use quick insert buttons that appear on selection.

1. Select an element
2. Click the **+** button that appears (above, below, left, or right)
3. Choose element type from menu
4. Element inserts and wraps in a stack automatically

**Keyboard shortcuts for insert:**
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> — Insert above
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd> — Insert below
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>j</kbd> — Insert left
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>l</kbd> — Insert right

The editor automatically creates wrapper stacks as needed to maintain layout structure.

### Creating multi-column layouts

**Problem:** You need elements in multiple columns with consistent spacing.

**Solution:** Use nested stacks with proper direction.

1. Create a horizontal stack (parent)
2. Add vertical stacks inside (columns)
3. Set parent gap for column spacing
4. Set column gaps for item spacing
5. Set column widths to fill for equal columns

**Example structure:**
```
Horizontal Stack (parent)
├── Vertical Stack (column 1, width: fill)
│   ├── Item A
│   └── Item B
├── Vertical Stack (column 2, width: fill)
│   ├── Item C
│   └── Item D
```

## Alignment picker

The 9-cell grid in the Inspector shows all alignment combinations. Click any cell to align children to that position.

**When gap is set to fill:** Picker shows 3 cells representing space-between distribution (start, center, end on cross axis only).

**Double-click any alignment cell:** Toggles between fill gap and 8px absolute gap.

This interaction makes switching between packed layouts and distributed layouts fast.

## Working in flow

Stay focused on design without getting stuck in layout mechanics:

**Quick insert buttons** — Add elements directionally without manual stack creation. The editor handles wrapping.

**Keyboard shortcuts** — Change direction, sizing, and alignment without opening panels. Press <kbd>/</kbd> for actions menu with all shortcuts.

**Ask AI for adjustments** — Select an icon and ask "make this a share icon" to swap icons quickly.

**Hide layout complexity** — Nested stacks auto-generate as you design. Focus on visual arrangement, not structure.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Element won't move to opposite side">

Check if gap is set to absolute pixels. Try **Option 1** (set gap to fill) or **Option 2** (set sibling width to fill). For horizontal stacks, use width fill. For vertical stacks, use height fill.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Alignment picker doesn't change anything">

You selected the child element instead of the parent stack. Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to select parent, then adjust alignment. Stack alignment applies to children, not the stack itself.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Stack has unwanted extra space">

Check if gap is set to fill. This creates space-between alignment. Switch to absolute gap (8px, 16px, 24px presets) for packed layouts. Or set a child element to fill to consume the space.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can't add element between two items">

Use quick insert buttons. Select an element, click the **+** button in the desired direction. The editor wraps elements in stacks automatically to maintain layout flow.
