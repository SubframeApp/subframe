title: Layers
description: Navigate and organize the element hierarchy.
---

The Layers panel shows your design's element hierarchy as a tree structure. Use it to select, reorder, and organize elements.

## Opening the Layers panel

Click the **Page** tab in the left sidebar to open the Layers panel. It shows all elements on the current page in a tree structure.

## Navigating the hierarchy

**Select an element** - Click any layer to select that element on the canvas. The Inspector updates to show its properties.

**Expand/collapse** - Click the arrow icon next to a layer to show or hide its children.

**Navigate with keyboard:**
- Press <kbd>↑</kbd> / <kbd>↓</kbd> to move between layers
- Press <kbd>→</kbd> to expand a layer
- Press <kbd>←</kbd> to collapse a layer
- Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select the highlighted layer

## Understanding hierarchy

The tree structure reflects parent-child relationships. Elements nested inside Stacks or other containers appear indented below their parent.

**Example hierarchy:**
```
Page
├── Container
│   └── Stack (vertical)
│       ├── Text (heading)
│       ├── Text (paragraph)
│       └── Button
└── Stack (horizontal)
    ├── Image
    └── Text
```

Children inherit layout behavior from their parents. A Stack controls how its children are arranged, sized, and spaced.

## Reordering elements

Drag layers up or down to reorder them.

**In Stacks** - Reordering changes the visual order. Drag a layer above or below its siblings to change their sequence.

**Z-index** - For overlapping elements, the bottom layer in the tree appears on top visually.

## Renaming layers

Double-click any layer name to rename it. Use descriptive names like "hero-heading" or "signup-button" to make complex designs easier to navigate.

Element names don't affect exported code—they're only for organization in the editor.

## Layer actions

**Show/hide** - Click the eye icon to toggle visibility. Hidden elements don't appear on the canvas or in exported code.

**Lock** - Click the lock icon to prevent accidental selection or editing. Locked elements stay visible but can't be modified until unlocked.

**Delete** - Select a layer and press <kbd>Delete</kbd> or <kbd>Backspace</kbd> to remove it.

**Duplicate** - Select a layer and press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> to duplicate it.

## Searching layers

Use the search box at the top of the Layers panel to filter layers by name. Type a few letters and only matching layers appear.
