description: Design production-ready interfaces in a responsive, flex-based editor.

The page editor is where you design interfaces that match how they'll behave in code. Unlike infinite canvas tools, Subframe uses a responsive page editor based on flexbox—similar to auto-layout systems—so what you design is exactly what you get in production.

## How the page editor works

Subframe's editor mirrors how web interfaces actually work. Elements flow and arrange using flexbox (Stacks), resize responsively, and adapt to different screen sizes. There's no manual positioning or guessing—elements behave the same way in the editor as they do in your app.

This approach means:
- Designs export as clean, production-ready code
- No translation layer between design and development
- Responsive behavior works automatically
- AI can generate interfaces that actually work

## Editor interface

The page editor is organized into three main areas:

**Left sidebar** - Two tabs for working with your design:
- **Page** tab - Shows the element hierarchy (layers panel). Navigate your design structure, reorder elements, and organize components.
- **Insert** tab - Browse and add elements. Drag components, primitives (Text, Image, Icon, Stack), and snippets onto the canvas.

**Canvas (center)** - Your design surface. Elements appear at their actual rendered size. The canvas shows exactly how your design will look at the current breakpoint.

**Right sidebar (Inspector)** - Context-aware property panel. Shows properties for the selected element. Configure layout, styling, typography, and component-specific settings.

**Top toolbar** - Mode switcher, device selector, zoom controls, and page settings.

Toggle sidebars with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>\\</kbd> (left) and <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> (right) for more canvas space.

## Flex-based layout system

Elements in Subframe use flexbox for layout, not absolute positioning. This is the key difference from infinite canvas tools.

**Stack containers** - The primary layout tool. Stacks arrange children in a direction (vertical, horizontal, or wrap) with automatic spacing and alignment. This matches CSS flexbox exactly.

**Responsive by default** - Elements resize and reflow automatically. Set width to "fill" and elements expand to available space. Set to "hug" and they shrink to fit content.

**Mobile overrides** - Design for desktop, then override specific properties for mobile. The same element responds to different screen sizes without duplicate versions.

This system ensures designs are production-ready from the start. No converting absolute positions to flexbox, no fixing broken responsive behavior, no surprises when you export code.

## Why this matters for AI

AI can generate working interfaces because the editor uses the same layout system as code. When AI creates a page, it arranges elements using Stacks, sets sizing to fill or hug, and applies spacing—exactly what a developer would do.

Traditional design tools require AI to guess pixel positions and manually size every element. Subframe's flex-based system lets AI create interfaces that actually work at any screen size.

## Canvas navigation

**Pan** - Hold <kbd>Space</kbd> and drag to move around the canvas.

**Zoom** - <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + scroll to zoom in/out.

**Fit to screen** - Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>0</kbd> to center and fit your page.

**Zoom to 100%** - Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>1</kbd> for actual size.

**Zoom to selection** - Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd> to focus on the selected element.

## Selecting elements

**Click to select** - Click any element to select it. The Inspector updates to show its properties.

**Multiple selection** - Hold <kbd>Cmd</kbd> and click to add elements, or drag to select multiple elements.

**Select parent** - Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to select the parent container.

**Navigate siblings** - Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to cycle through elements at the same level.

## Smart guides

As you drag elements, guides appear to show alignment and spacing. Guides help you align with other elements, maintain consistent gaps, and snap to pixel-perfect positions.

Unlike absolute positioning tools, guides in Subframe show the actual spacing in the flex layout—the gaps you see are the CSS gap values that will export.

## Breakpoints

Switch between default (desktop/tablet) and mobile views using the device selector in the toolbar.

Design for desktop first. Elements automatically resize and reflow based on their flex properties. Then add mobile overrides for specific properties that need different values on small screens.

The mobile breakpoint is 768px. Preview how your design adapts by switching breakpoints or resizing the browser window.
