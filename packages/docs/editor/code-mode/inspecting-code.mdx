title: Inspecting code
description: View and export code from your designs
---

Code Mode shows your design as code. Switch between React + Tailwind, CSS, Properties, or AI prompts based on your codebase.

## Opening Code Mode

Click the **Code** button in the mode switcher at the top of the editor. The inspector switches to show three tabs: Inspect, Installation, and Prompts.

## Inspect tab

The Inspect tab has a format dropdown with four options:

**React + Tailwind** - Full TSX component code with Tailwind classes
**CSS** - CSS-only styles (desktop and mobile variants)
**Properties** - Visual list of all element properties
**Replit** - AI-friendly prompt format with embedded code

### MCP server link

At the top, you'll see a copyable link to your design. This link works with AI tools that support MCP (Model Context Protocol):

```
https://app.subframe.com/...
```

Paste this link into Cursor or Claude Code to reference your design when prompting AI.

### Syncing components

Below the MCP link is a sync command. When you select an element, it shows the CLI command to sync that component:

```bash
npx subframe@latest sync --component Button Card
```

When nothing is selected, it shows the command to sync all components on the page.

## Code formats

### React + Tailwind

Shows full TSX code with imports and Tailwind classes.

**When an element is selected:**
- Import statements for the component
- Code snippet for just that element
- Button to view full page source

**When nothing is selected:**
- Complete page component with all imports
- Full JSX structure
- Syntax highlighting

### CSS

Shows CSS properties extracted from your design.

**When an element is selected:**
- Component properties (text, icon, image values)
- "CSS (desktop)" code block
- "CSS (mobile)" code block if styles differ
- Or "Ready to use - no additional CSS needed" if no custom CSS required

**When nothing is selected:**
- "Select an element to inspect" message

### Properties

Lists all visual properties as structured data.

**When an element is selected:**
- Component props (text, variant, etc.)
- Layout properties (width, height, padding, gap, alignment)
- Typography properties (font, color, decoration)
- Border and shadow properties
- Separate "Mobile" section if mobile properties differ

**When nothing is selected:**
- "Select an element to inspect" message

### Replit

Pre-formatted prompts for Replit Agent.

**When an element is selected:**
- "Copy snippet prompt to Replit" button
- Prompt includes: instructions + TSX code + imports + sync command

**When nothing is selected:**
- "Copy prompt to Replit" button
- Prompt includes: sync command + instructions + full page TSX

## Settings

Click the three-dot menu next to the format dropdown to access settings:

**Render icons as components** - Toggle to render icons as `<SubframeCore.Icon>` components instead of inline SVG (disabled if project has uploaded custom icons)
