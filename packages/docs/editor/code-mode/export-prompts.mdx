The Prompts tab in Code Mode provides five ready-made prompts for integrating Subframe designs with AI coding assistants. Each prompt includes your design URL and specific sync commands.

## Available prompts

### 1. Sync all components in current page

Syncs all Subframe components used on the current page to your project.

**Prompt includes:**
```bash
npx subframe@latest sync --component Button Card TextField
```

The command lists all components on the page. Copy and run it in your terminal, or paste into an AI tool to have it execute.

### 2. Create a new page from the current design

Creates a new page/route using your Subframe design.

**Prompt says:**
```
Create a new page using the Subframe page at [YOUR_DESIGN_URL] as reference.

Use Subframe's MCP server to get the code for the design. Wire up relevant
app logic (API calls, hooks, routing) where applicable. Keep it consistent
with existing project conventions.

Run the following command to sync all components in the page:
npx subframe@latest sync --component [component-names]
```

AI tools with MCP support will fetch your design code automatically.

### 3. Update an existing page based on the current design

Updates an existing page to match your Subframe design.

**Prompt says:**
```
Update the existing page to match the Subframe design at [YOUR_DESIGN_URL].

Use Subframe's MCP server to get the updated code. Preserve all existing
functionality unless the new design requires a change.

Run the following command to sync all components in the page:
npx subframe@latest sync --component [component-names]
```

This preserves your business logic while updating the UI.

### 4. Add accessibility tags

Reviews your design and adds proper accessibility attributes.

**Prompt says:**
```
Review the Subframe design at [YOUR_DESIGN_URL] and add proper accessibility
attributes to the existing page.

Use Subframe's MCP server to reference the design. Add ARIA labels, roles,
and descriptions, and proper semantic HTML throughout.

Run the following command to sync all components in the page:
npx subframe@latest sync --component [component-names]
```

### 5. Migrate to Subframe design system

Migrates an existing page to use Subframe components.

**Prompt says:**
```
Migrate the components on the existing page to use Subframe components
instead of the old components.

You may use the Subframe design at [YOUR_DESIGN_URL] as reference and
connect to Subframe's MCP server to get code. Preserve all existing
functionality unless the new design requires a change.

Run the following command to sync all components in the page:
npx subframe@latest sync --component [component-names]
```

Useful when replacing an old component library with Subframe.

## How to use prompts

1. Click the **Prompts** tab in Code Mode
2. Choose the prompt that matches your task
3. Click **Copy** on the prompt section
4. Paste into your AI coding tool (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.)
5. The AI reads the prompt and executes the task

## MCP server requirement

These prompts work best with AI tools that have the Subframe MCP server installed. The prompts reference `[YOUR_DESIGN_URL]`, which MCP-enabled tools use to fetch your design code.

Without MCP, you'll need to manually copy code from the Inspect tab and include it in your prompts.
