description: Learn the Subframe editor interface and navigate between editing modes.
---

The Subframe editor is where you design pages, build components, and export production-ready code. Switch between four modes—Design, Ask AI, Prototype, and Code—depending on your task.

## Editor modes

**Design Mode** - Visual editing for layouts, components, and styling. Add elements, adjust properties, and build your design system. Most of your work happens here.

**Ask AI** - Generate designs from text prompts or images. AI creates pages and components based on your descriptions. Useful for rapid prototyping or getting started.

**Prototype Mode** - Add interactions and annotations to designs. Share clickable prototypes with your team. No code required.

**Code Mode** - View generated React + Tailwind code. Copy components, adjust export settings, or export to AI coding tools like Cursor.

Switch modes using the mode selector buttons at the top of the editor.

## Interface layout

### Canvas

The canvas is your design surface. Add elements, arrange layouts, and preview your design at different breakpoints. Zoom with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + scroll or pan by holding <kbd>Space</kbd> and dragging.

### Left sidebar

**Page** - View and organize the element hierarchy for the current page. Select, reorder, or group elements.

**Insert** - Browse and insert components, layouts, and UI elements. Search or drag components onto the canvas.

Toggle the sidebar with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>\\</kbd>.

### Right sidebar (Inspector)

Configure the selected element. The inspector shows properties, styling options, and component-specific settings. Changes here update the canvas in real-time.

Toggle the inspector with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd>.

### Top toolbar

Access project settings, undo/redo, zoom controls, and the mode selector. The toolbar also shows your current page and breakpoint.

## Navigation

**Project switcher** - Click your project name (top left) to switch between projects or create a new one.

**Breadcrumbs** - See your current location in the project hierarchy. Click to navigate up.

**Command palette** - Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> to search for pages, components, or actions. Fastest way to navigate large projects.

## Collaboration

Multiple team members can edit simultaneously. See who's viewing or editing with avatars in the top right. Changes sync in real-time—no save button needed.
