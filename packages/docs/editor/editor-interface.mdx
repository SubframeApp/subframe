description: Learn the Subframe editor interface and navigate between editing modes.
---

The Subframe editor is where you design pages, build components, and export production-ready code. Switch between four modes—Design, Ask AI, Prototype, and Code—depending on your task.

## Editor modes

Switch modes using the mode selector buttons at the top of the editor.

### Page canvas

The canvas is your design surface. Add elements, arrange layouts, and preview your design at different breakpoints.

### Navigation panel (left sidebar)

**Navigation** – Easily switch between pages and flows, or subcomponents when in the component editor.

**Layers** - View and organize the element hierarchy for the current page. Select, reorder, or group elements.

**Insert** - Browse and insert components and snippets. Search or drag components onto the canvas.

### Inspector (right sidebar)

The inspector shows properties, styling options, and component-specific properties. Changes here update the canvas in real-time.


## Collaboration

Multiple team members can edit simultaneously. See who's viewing or editing the current page with avatars in the top nav.
