title: Chat with AI
description: Converse with AI to build and refine your prototype.
---

Use chat to refine prototypes conversationally. Best for bug fixes, complex logic, and iterative improvements after annotations establish core interactions.

**When to use:** Bug fixes, multi-element changes, complex logic hard to describe per-element

**When to use annotations:** Core interactions, element-specific behavior, persistent instructions

## Starting a conversation

After adding annotations:

1. Type your request in the chat input
2. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to send
3. AI generates code and responds

First message creates your prototype. Subsequent messages refine it. Generation takes 15-60 seconds.

## Generating your prototype

Your first message creates the prototype from all annotations:

> "Build a working prototype with the interactions I've annotated"

AI analyzes your designs and generates:
- React code for each page
- Navigation between pages
- Form handlers and validation
- State management

## Refining behavior

After initial generation, adjust with chat:

**Add features:**
- "Show error toast if login fails"
- "Add loading spinner while submitting"

**Fix issues:**
- "Mobile menu doesn't close when clicking outside"
- "Cart total isn't updating when quantities change"

**Improve interactions:**
- "Add smooth transitions when switching tabs"
- "Disable submit button while form is invalid"

## Conversation view

Switch between **Annotations** and **Conversation** tabs in the right panel.

Conversation shows:
- Your messages and AI responses
- Code generation progress
- Clickable prototype versions
- Error states

Click any version to preview or restore it.

## Quick actions

**Annotate** — Toggle annotation mode

**Edit design** — Switch to Design Mode

**Start over** — Rebuild from scratch using current annotations

**Add pages** — Manage pages in your flow

## Error handling

If your prototype has errors:

1. See the error message in preview
2. Click **Fix error** on the banner
3. AI receives full stack trace and attempts fix
4. Test the updated version

## Best practices

**Be specific:**
- ✓ "Make search filter products in real-time as user types"
- ✗ "Add search functionality"

**Reference elements clearly:**
- ✓ "Blue 'Get Started' button in hero should navigate to /signup"
- ✗ "Make the button work"

**Request one change at a time:** Small requests are easier for AI to implement correctly.

**Test after each change:** Preview before requesting more changes.

**Use annotations for persistence:** Add to annotations if behavior should survive rebuilds.

## Update vs rebuild

**Update (default)** — Modifies existing code, preserves functionality

**Rebuild (Start over)** — Generates fresh code from annotations only

Use rebuild when prototype has bugs or you've made major design changes.
