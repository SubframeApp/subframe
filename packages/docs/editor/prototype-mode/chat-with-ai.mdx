title: Chat with AI
description: Converse with AI to build and refine your prototype.
---

The AI chat panel lets you describe prototype behavior conversationally. After adding annotations, chat with AI to refine logic, add features, or fix issues.

## Starting the conversation

Click **Chat with AI** in Prototype Mode. The chat panel appears on the right.

Describe what you want your prototype to do:
- "Make the login form validate email format and require a password"
- "Add a shopping cart that tracks items and shows the total"
- "Create a tabs component that switches content when clicked"

AI reads your annotations and design, then generates code to implement the behavior.

## Refining your prototype

Ask AI to adjust the prototype:

**Add features:**
- "Also show an error message if login fails"
- "Add a loading spinner while submitting"

**Fix issues:**
- "The menu doesn't close when clicking outside"
- "Make the cart total update when quantities change"

**Improve behavior:**
- "Add smooth transitions when tabs switch"
- "Disable submit button while form is invalid"

## Example conversation

> You: "Make this contact form collect name, email, and message, then show a success notification"
>
> AI: *Generates form handling code*
>
> You: "Add email validation and disable the button if fields are empty"
>
> AI: *Updates code with validation*
>
> You: "Show an error state on invalid email"
>
> AI: *Adds error styling and logic*

Each message builds on the previous context.

## Best practices

**Be conversational** - Ask naturally, like you're talking to a developer

**Reference specific elements** - "The blue button" or "the email input"

**Request one change at a time** - Easier for AI to implement correctly

**Test after changes** - Preview your prototype to verify behavior before requesting more changes
