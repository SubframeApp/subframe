title: Annotations
description: Add instructions to guide AI prototype generation.
---

Annotations tell AI how elements should behave. Click an element and describe what it does—AI generates the code to make it work.

## Adding annotations

1. Switch to Prototype Mode
2. Click any element on the canvas
3. Type what it should do in the annotation field
4. Press Enter to save

The annotation appears as a numbered marker on the element.

## Example annotations

**Navigation:**
- "Navigate to /pricing page"
- "Go back to home"
- "Open product details"

**State changes:**
- "Toggle mobile menu"
- "Show password"
- "Expand accordion"

**Form interactions:**
- "Submit form and show success message"
- "Validate email format"
- "Clear all inputs"

**Conditional logic:**
- "Show error if email is invalid"
- "Disable button if form is incomplete"

## Managing annotations

**Edit** - Click an annotation marker to modify the text

**Delete** - Click the X next to an annotation to remove it

**View all** - The annotation panel on the right lists all annotations in order

## Writing good annotations

**Be specific** - "Navigate to pricing page" is clearer than "go to next page"

**Describe outcomes** - "Show success toast" not just "handle submit"

**Include conditions** - "Disable submit button while form is empty"

**One action per annotation** - Split complex behaviors into multiple annotations
