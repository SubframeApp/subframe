title: Annotations
description: Add instructions to guide AI prototype generation.
---

Annotations tell AI how elements should behave. Click an element and describe what it does—AI generates the code to make it work.

**Design is the best prompt.** Your visual design already embeds functionality context—subscribe buttons, search boxes, navigation links. Annotations add the missing piece: what happens when users interact.

**Annotations persist as code comments.** When you regenerate prototypes, annotations ensure consistent results. LLMs become a programming language where prompts are embedded in the design itself.

## Adding annotations

1. Switch to Prototype Mode
2. Click any element on the canvas
3. Type what it should do in the annotation field
4. Press Enter to save

The annotation appears as a numbered marker on the element.

## Example annotations

**Navigation:**
- "Navigate to /pricing page"
- "Go back to home"
- "Open product details in new page"

**State changes:**
- "Toggle mobile menu visibility"
- "Show password when clicked"
- "Expand accordion section"

**Form interactions:**
- "Submit form and show success message"
- "Validate email format on submit"
- "Clear all inputs when reset is clicked"

**Working app logic:**
- "Build a working interactive time zone tracker using current time and date"
- "Create subtle gradient based on current time of day"
- "Search every city and time zone database"
- "Animate cards when adding new time zones"

**Conditional logic:**
- "Show error if email is invalid"
- "Disable submit button while form is empty"
- "Display loading state during API call"

## Managing annotations

**Edit** - Click an annotation marker to modify the text

**Delete** - Click the X next to an annotation to remove it

**View all** - The annotation panel on the right lists all annotations in order

## Writing good annotations

**Be specific** - "Navigate to pricing page" is clearer than "go to next page"

**Describe outcomes** - "Show success toast" not just "handle submit"

**Include conditions** - "Disable submit button while form is empty"

**One action per annotation** - Split complex behaviors into multiple annotations
