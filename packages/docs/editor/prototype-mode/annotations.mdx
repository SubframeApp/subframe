title: Annotations
description: Add instructions to guide AI prototype generation.
---

Annotations tell AI how elements behave. Click an element, describe what it does, and AI generates the code.

Your visual design embeds functionality context—buttons, forms, navigation. Annotations add the "what happens when" layer. They persist as code comments, ensuring consistent results across regenerations.

## Adding annotations

Click **Annotate** in the chat bar to enter annotation mode.

1. Click any element on the canvas
2. Type what it should do in the annotation card
3. Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> to save

Blue dots mark annotated elements. Hover to see annotations.

### Annotations inspector

View all annotations in the right panel:

1. Switch to **Annotations** tab
2. See all pages with their annotations
3. Click an annotation to navigate to that element
4. Drag pages to reorder

## Writing effective annotations

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Navigation">

- "Navigate to /pricing page"
- "Go back to home page when clicked"
- "Open product details in new page"

**Best practice:** Be specific about destination
- ✓ "Navigate to pricing page and scroll to Pro tier"
- ✗ "Go to next page"

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="State changes">

- "Toggle mobile menu visibility"
- "Show password when eye icon is clicked"
- "Expand accordion section on click"

**Best practice:** Describe complete interactions
- ✓ "Toggle menu and trap focus inside when open"
- ✗ "Toggle menu"

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Form interactions">

- "Submit form and show success message"
- "Validate email format before submitting"
- "Clear all inputs when reset button is clicked"

**Best practice:** Include validation and outcomes
- ✓ "Submit form, validate fields, show error if invalid, success if valid"
- ✗ "Handle submit"

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Conditional logic">

- "Show error message if email is invalid"
- "Disable submit button while form is empty"
- "Display loading spinner during API call"

**Best practice:** Include conditions clearly
- ✓ "Disable submit button while form is empty or invalid"
- ✗ "Disable button sometimes"

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Working app logic">

- "Build interactive time zone tracker using current time and date"
- "Search city database when user types"
- "Animate cards when adding new time zones"

**Best practice:** Reference data sources
- ✓ "Search cities database using time zone API"
- ✗ "Make it searchable"

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Component attachments">

Paste Subframe component URLs into annotations for AI reference:

1. Copy component link from Components tab
2. Paste into annotation field
3. Preview appears showing the component
4. AI uses it when generating code

**Example:** "Use this CardList component to display search results"

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**General best practice:** One action per annotation—split complex behaviors across multiple elements.

## How annotations become code

When generating prototypes, AI:

1. Creates `designs/ANNOTATIONS.md` with all annotations organized by page
2. Embeds annotations as comments in generated code files
3. Uses annotation context to implement interactions

Example generated code:
```tsx designs/PricingPage.tsx
export default function PricingPage() {
  // ANNOTATION: Navigate to signup page when clicked
  const handleGetStarted = () => {
    // Implementation here
  }

  return (
    <Button onClick={handleGetStarted}>
      Get Started
    </Button>
  )
}
```

## When to use annotations vs chat

**Use annotations for:**
- Core interactions you're defining
- Element-specific behavior
- Instructions that should persist across rebuilds

**Use chat for:**
- Bug fixes in existing prototypes
- Changes affecting multiple elements
- Complex logic hard to describe per-element
