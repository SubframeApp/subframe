description: Organize page designs to build better prototypes.
---

Prototypes generate from your page designs. Organize pages thoughtfully before generating—AI uses all pages in your flow as context.

## Design first, prototype second

Build complete screens before prototyping. AI generates better code when it sees all pages and states together.

Start with 3-5 designed pages per flow. AI understands page relationships, implements state transitions, and creates realistic navigation from complete designs.

## Organizing pages in flows

Flows are folders that group related pages. Each flow has one prototype containing all its pages.

**Add pages to flow:**
1. Open **Pages** panel in left sidebar
2. Drag page onto existing flow
3. Or right-click page and select **Move to flow**

**Remove pages from flow:**
1. Drag page out to root level
2. Or move to different flow

**Create new flow:**
Click **New flow** button in Pages panel. Each flow maintains independent prototype and chat history.

<Tip>
Keep flows small (3-8 pages) for faster generation. Large flows (15+ pages) push performance limits.
</Tip>

## Best practices

**Design complete flows:** Create all key screens before prototyping. Partial flows lead to incomplete navigation.

**Show all states:** Document different page states—AI uses these as concrete examples when implementing logic.
- Loading: `Dashboard`, `Dashboard - Loading`, `Dashboard - Empty`
- Form: `Checkout`, `Checkout - Filled`, `Checkout - Error`
- Modal: `Settings`, `Settings - Edit Profile Modal`
- Multi-step: `Onboarding - Step 1`, `Onboarding - Step 2`

**Use descriptive names:** AI reads page names as context clues. Use clear names like `Product List - Filtered` instead of `Page 1`. Add state suffixes: `Cart - Empty`, `Cart - With Items`.

**Order pages logically:** Position pages in user journey order (e.g., signup → profile → dashboard). AI generates smoother navigation from logical ordering.

**Use realistic content:** AI generates better code from real text and images than lorem ipsum.

**Keep flows focused:** One flow = one user journey. Don't mix unrelated pages.

**Start small:** Begin with 3-5 pages. Add more as you test and refine.

**Test after updates:** Interact with prototype after applying changes. Check modified pages, verify navigation, watch for errors.

## Syncing design changes

After generating a prototype, continue refining page designs in Design Mode. Subframe auto-detects changes and shows **Apply** banner in Prototype Mode.

**What triggers updates:**
- Page edits (move elements, update styles, add components)
- Pages added/removed from flow
- Annotation changes
- Theme or component updates

Click **Apply** to regenerate prototype with changes (15-60 seconds). AI updates code to match new design while preserving functionality when possible.

<Warning>
Design changes don't sync back from prototypes to pages. Always edit in Design Mode, then apply to prototype.
</Warning>

## Update vs rebuild

**Apply (recommended)** — AI receives diff showing what changed, modifies existing code, preserves functionality. Use for incremental updates.

**Start over (rebuild)** — Click **Start over** in chat bar. Generates fresh code from annotations only, ignores previous prototype. Use when prototype has bugs or after major structural changes.

<Note>
Rebuild discards chat refinements. Annotations persist, but prompts added via chat don't.
</Note>

## Version history

Every generation creates a versioned snapshot. Restore any previous version:

1. Switch to **Conversation** view in right panel
2. Find previous prototype versions
3. Click **Restore this version** on any older version
4. Confirm to create new version from selected state

Versions capture code state, not design state. Restoring reverts functionality, not page designs.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Page not appearing in prototype">

- Verify page is inside flow (not at root level)
- Check you clicked **Apply** after adding
- Confirm prototype regenerated successfully

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Changes not detected">

- Ensure you're in Prototype Mode (switch from Design Mode)
- Check changes are in pages within current flow
- Verify prototype exists (changes only detected after first generation)

Try switching to Design Mode and back to trigger detection.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Update fails with errors">

1. Click **Fix error** on error banner—AI receives full stack trace
2. Use chat to describe what you changed
3. Click **Start over** for clean rebuild
4. Or restore previous working version

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Functionality lost after update">

AI may make different implementation choices when updating. Solutions:

1. Restore previous version from Conversation view
2. Try applying changes again
3. Use chat to explain what broke
4. Consider **Start over** if multiple updates accumulated

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Too many pages slows generation">

Recommended: 3-8 pages per flow. Maximum: ~15 pages before performance degrades.

Split into multiple focused flows for better performance.
