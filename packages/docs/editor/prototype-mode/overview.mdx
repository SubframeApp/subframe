title: Prototype mode overview
description: Create interactive prototypes with AI-powered code generation.
---

Prototype Mode turns your static designs into interactive prototypes using AI. Add annotations describing interactions, chat with AI to refine behavior, and test your prototype instantly.

## How it works

1. **Add annotations** - Click elements and describe what they should do ("Navigate to pricing page", "Toggle menu")
2. **Chat with AI** - Refine interactions and add logic through conversation
3. **Generate prototype** - AI creates working code that powers your interactions
4. **Test immediately** - Click through your prototype to verify behavior

Prototypes run in the browser with real interactions—no external tools needed.

## What you can prototype

**Navigation** - Link buttons to other pages in your project

**State changes** - Toggle visibility, update text, change styles

**Form interactions** - Handle input validation and submission

**Conditional logic** - Show/hide elements based on conditions

**Data display** - Mock API responses and dynamic content

## Switch to Prototype Mode

Click the **Prototype** tab at the top of the editor or press <kbd>3</kbd>. Your design appears with an annotation panel on the right.
