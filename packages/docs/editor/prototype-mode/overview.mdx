description: Create interactive prototypes with AI-powered code generation.

Prototype Mode turns your static designs into interactive prototypes using AI. Add annotations to your design—comments become prompts that drive behavior. Design is the best prompt.

## How it works

**Design-first approach:** Your visual design already describes functionality. Buttons, forms, navigation—all context for AI. Annotations add the "what happens when" layer.

**Annotations over chat:** After designing, add comments describing interactions directly on elements. AI generates working prototypes that match your design exactly. No chat required for basic interactions—annotations capture your intent on the design itself.

1. **Design your screens** - Build UI in Design Mode or generate with AI
2. **Add annotations** - Click elements and describe what they should do ("Navigate to pricing page", "Toggle menu")
3. **Generate prototype** - AI creates working code that powers your interactions
4. **Test immediately** - Click through your prototype to verify behavior
5. **Use chat for refinements** - Complex logic or bug fixes work better in chat

Prototypes run in the browser with real interactions—no external tools needed.

## What you can prototype

**Navigation** - Link buttons to other pages in your project

**State changes** - Toggle visibility, update text, change styles

**Form interactions** - Handle input validation and submission

**Conditional logic** - Show/hide elements based on conditions

**Data display** - Mock API responses and dynamic content

## Switch to Prototype Mode

Click the **Prototype** tab at the top of the editor or press <kbd>3</kbd>. Your design appears with an annotation panel on the right.
