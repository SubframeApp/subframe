title: Updating designs
description: Rebuild prototypes when designs change.
---

When you modify your design after building a prototype, you'll need to regenerate the prototype code to reflect those changes.

## When to update

Update your prototype after:
- Adding or removing elements
- Changing element IDs or structure
- Modifying component properties
- Adjusting layouts or styles that affect interactions

Minor style changes (colors, spacing) usually don't require updates unless they're referenced in your prototype logic.

## Regenerating the prototype

Click **Regenerate** in Prototype Mode. AI analyzes your updated design and annotations, then generates new code incorporating the changes.

Your existing annotations and chat history remain—AI uses them to recreate the prototype with the new design structure.

## What gets preserved

**Annotations** - All element annotations stay in place

**Chat history** - Your conversation with AI is retained

**Interaction logic** - AI attempts to maintain the same behavior with the updated structure

## What might break

**Renamed elements** - If you rename elements that annotations reference, AI might not reconnect them automatically

**Removed elements** - Annotations on deleted elements are removed

**Restructured layouts** - Significant layout changes may require updating your annotations

## Testing after updates

Always test your prototype after regenerating:
1. Click **Preview** to open the prototype
2. Test all interactions and navigation
3. Check for broken functionality
4. Use chat to fix any issues
