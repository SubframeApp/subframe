View the code AI generated for your prototype. This helps you understand how interactions work and prepare for production implementation.

## Viewing the code

Click **View Code** in Prototype Mode. The code panel shows the React component with your prototype logic.

The generated code includes:
- React state hooks for managing UI state
- Event handlers for button clicks and form submissions
- Conditional rendering for show/hide logic
- Navigation logic for page transitions

## Code structure

AI generates clean, readable React code using hooks:

```tsx
const [isMenuOpen, setIsMenuOpen] = useState(false);
const [email, setEmail] = useState('');

const handleSubmit = () => {
  // Form submission logic
};
```

Each annotation becomes an event handler or state change in the code.

## Using prototype code

**Learning** - See how AI implemented your annotations

**Reference** - Copy patterns for your production code

**Export** - Use as a starting point for development

The code is production-ready React + Tailwind, but you'll likely want to add:
- API integration
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Real data sources

## Limitations

Prototype code is meant for testing interactions, not production. It:
- Uses mock data instead of real APIs
- Has simplified error handling
- May not include all edge cases
- Focuses on UI behavior over business logic
