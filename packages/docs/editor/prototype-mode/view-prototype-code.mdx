title: View prototype code
description: Inspect and export the generated prototype code.
---

View the React code powering your prototype. Inspect files, review implementation, and download as a Vite project.

## Viewing code

Each prototype version has a code icon:

1. Switch to **Conversation** view in right panel
2. Find the prototype version to inspect
3. Click the code icon (`</>`) on that message
4. Code viewer appears with file tree and syntax highlighting

View code for any version, not just the latest. Compare implementations across iterations.

## File structure

Organized as a Vite React project:

**Root files:**
- `App.tsx` — Main app with routing
- `index.tsx` — React render entry
- `package.json` — Dependencies
- `load-assets.ts` — Tailwind CDN
- `fonts.ts` — Google Fonts
- `styles.css` — Global styles

**designs/ folder:**
- One file per page (`HomePage.tsx`, `PricingPage.tsx`)
- `ANNOTATIONS.md` — All annotations for AI reference
- Each page includes embedded annotation comments

**ui/ folder:**
- Your design system components from Subframe
- Read-only, updates when you sync components

**external/ folder (BYOC only):**
- Wrapper components for external dependencies
- `tsconfig.json` with path mappings

## Annotation embedding

Annotations persist as code comments:

```tsx designs/LoginPage.tsx
export default function LoginPage() {
  // ANNOTATION: Submit form and show success message
  const handleSubmit = async () => {
    // Implementation here
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {/* ... */}
    </form>
  )
}
```

## Downloading code

Click **Download** to save as ZIP:

1. Extract the ZIP file
2. Run `npm install && npm run dev`
3. Edit locally in your code editor

<Note>
The ui/ folder contains component snapshots at download time. For latest versions, sync components in your main project.
</Note>

## Use cases

- **Test interactions** before production implementation
- **Share demos** with stakeholders
- **Start features** using code as foundation
- **Learn implementations** to see how AI solved problems
- **Extract logic** for state management or handlers

## Limitations

Prototypes are for demonstration, not production:

- Uses Tailwind CDN, not production build
- Simple routing, not React Router
- Mock data, no real APIs
- Sandpack browser-only execution
- Frontend code only

For production, use [MCP server](/developing/mcp-server) to integrate Subframe designs with your full app.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Downloaded code won't run">

1. Run `npm install` first
2. Check Node version (requires 16+)
3. Try `npm run dev`
4. Check console for missing dependencies

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Missing files in download">

- Reload page and try again
- Verify prototype generated successfully
- Try different browser

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can't edit code">

Code viewer is read-only. To modify:
- Download the project and edit locally
- Or use chat to have AI make changes
