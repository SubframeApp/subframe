title: Sharing prototypes
description: Share interactive prototypes with your team or stakeholders.
---

Share prototypes via public link. Anyone with the link can interact in their browser—no Subframe account required.

## Enabling sharing

1. Switch to Prototype Mode (<kbd>3</kbd>)
2. Find **Share** section in right panel
3. Toggle **Enable public sharing**
4. Click **Copy link**

Link stays active while sharing is enabled and project exists.

## What viewers see

Full interactive experience:
- Click buttons, fill forms, navigate pages
- Live Sandpack preview with real React code
- Responsive behavior at all screen sizes
- All pages in the flow
- Always shows latest version

Viewers cannot see your Subframe project, source code, annotations, or conversation history.

## Permissions

- **Owners and editors** can enable/disable sharing
- **Viewers** cannot toggle sharing (hidden)
- Each flow has independent shareable link

## Updating shared prototypes

Changes apply automatically:

1. Edit designs or annotations
2. Click **Apply** to regenerate
3. Link shows new version immediately

Viewers see latest version on refresh. No need to send new link.

## Disabling sharing

Toggle off **Enable public sharing**. Link stops working immediately.

## Use cases

Share working prototypes for:
- Stakeholder demos and client presentations
- User testing and feedback
- Team design reviews
- Investor presentations
- Documentation and wikis
- Async collaboration

## Security

<Warning>
Public links are accessible to anyone. Don't share sensitive or confidential designs publicly.
</Warning>

Links have:
- No authentication required
- No expiration (active until disabled)
- No analytics on views
- No password protection

For private sharing, invite team members to your project instead.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can't enable sharing">

- Verify you have a generated prototype (not just annotations)
- Check your project role (Viewers cannot enable)
- Try regenerating the prototype

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Link shows error for viewers">

- Verify sharing is still enabled
- Check prototype and project still exist
- Try disabling and re-enabling for new link

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Viewers see old version">

- Have viewers hard refresh (<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>)
- Verify regeneration completed successfully
- Wait a few seconds for CDN update
