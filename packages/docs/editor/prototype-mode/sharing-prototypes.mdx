title: Sharing prototypes
description: Share interactive prototypes with your team or stakeholders.
---

Share your prototype with anyone via a public link. They can interact with it in their browser without a Subframe account.

## Generating a share link

1. Click **Share** in the top toolbar
2. Enable **Public preview link**
3. Copy the link

Anyone with the link can view and interact with your prototype. The link stays active as long as your project exists.

## What viewers see

Viewers get the full interactive prototype:
- Click buttons and navigate pages
- Test forms and interactions
- View responsive behavior at different screen sizes
- Experience the prototype exactly as you designed it

They cannot edit the design or see your Subframe project.

## Updating shared prototypes

When you update your prototype and regenerate it, the share link automatically shows the latest version. No need to send a new link.

## Disabling sharing

Toggle off **Public preview link** in the share settings to disable the link. Anyone trying to access it will see an error.
