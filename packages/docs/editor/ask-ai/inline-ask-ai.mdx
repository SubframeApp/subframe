Inline Ask AI lets you make quick AI-powered edits to specific elements without switching modes. Select an element, describe the change, and AI updates it instantly.

## How to use it

1. Select an element on the canvas
2. Right-click and choose **Ask AI** (or press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd>)
3. Type what you want to change
4. Press Enter and AI applies the edit

The AI understands your theme and surrounding context, so changes match your existing design.

## Example edits

**Styling changes:**
- "Make this heading larger"
- "Change button to primary color"
- "Add more padding"
- "Make text bold"

**Content updates:**
- "Change text to 'Get Started'"
- "Add a description below this"
- "Use a different icon"

**Layout adjustments:**
- "Center this element"
- "Add space between these cards"
- "Move icon to the right"
- "Stack these vertically on mobile"

**Adding elements:**
- "Add a submit button below this"
- "Insert an icon before the heading"
- "Add a divider after this section"

## Quick insert

Hover near the edge of any selected element to see **+** buttons. Click one and describe what to insert:

- "Add a cancel button" — AI adds a button next to the current element
- "Insert an email field" — AI adds the field with appropriate styling
- "Add a subtitle" — AI inserts text below with correct hierarchy

Quick insert is faster than manually adding and configuring elements.

## Tips for better results

**Be specific** - "Make text 24px" works better than "make it bigger"

**Use relative terms** - "Darker", "larger", "more space" when you want AI to decide the exact value

**One change at a time** - Multiple edits in one prompt can be unpredictable

**Reference your theme** - AI knows "brand color", "heading font", "primary button"

**Chain edits** - Make one change, then another, rather than undoing and starting over

## Limitations

**Selection matters** - AI only edits what you have selected. Select the wrong element and changes go to the wrong place.

**Complex requests** - "Redesign this section" won't work well. Use full Ask AI mode for large changes.

**Interpretation** - AI makes its best guess. If results are wrong, undo and rephrase.
