Prompt to Design uses AI to generate complete page designs from text descriptions. Describe what you want to build, and Subframe AI creates a fully designed page using your theme and component library.

## How it works

Ask AI understands your project context—your theme colors, typography, existing components, and design patterns. When you describe a page, it generates designs that match your brand and use components from your library.

The AI can create entire pages (landing pages, dashboards, forms) or individual sections. You get 1-4 design variations to choose from, then you can refine the design with follow-up prompts or edit it manually.

## Accessing Ask AI

Click the **Ask AI** button in the mode switcher at the top-right of the editor. The Ask AI panel appears on the right side where you can type prompts and review generated designs.

You can also press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> to quickly open Ask AI.

## Writing effective prompts

The more specific your prompt, the better the results. Include details about layout, content, and purpose.

### Be specific about structure

Instead of "a contact form", try:
> "Create a contact form with fields for name, email, phone number, a message textarea, and a submit button. Add a heading 'Get in Touch' and a subheading explaining we'll respond within 24 hours."

### Describe the layout

Specify arrangement and spacing:
> "Create a features section with three columns on desktop that stack vertically on mobile. Each feature should have an icon, heading, and description text."

### Reference your components

Ask AI knows your component library:
> "Create a dashboard with a Card component for each metric, using our Button component for actions and TextField components for the search bar."

### Set the mood

Describe the feel you want:
> "Create a modern, minimal landing page hero with lots of whitespace and bold typography"

## Example prompts

**Landing page hero:**
> "Create a hero section with a bold headline about AI-powered design, a paragraph explaining the benefits, an email capture form with a single input and submit button, and a small note about privacy below."

**Dashboard overview:**
> "Create a dashboard with a header showing 'Monthly Overview', four metric cards in a row displaying Revenue, Users, Conversions, and Growth Rate, and below that a section for recent activity with a table."

**Settings form:**
> "Create a settings page with sections for Profile (name, email, avatar), Notifications (toggle switches for email and push notifications), and Danger Zone (a delete account button with warning text)."

**Navigation header:**
> "Create a navigation bar with our logo on the left, menu links in the center (Features, Pricing, About, Docs), and Sign In and Start Free buttons on the right."

## Generating designs

1. **Enter your prompt** in the text area
2. **Choose variation count** — Generate 1, 2, or 4 design variations
3. **Click Generate** and wait for AI to create the designs
4. **Review the variations** using the thumbnails or arrows to navigate

## Applying designs

Once you find a variation you like:

- **Apply to current page** — Replace your current design
- **Save as new page** — Create a new page with this design
- **Mix and match** — Drag elements from variations into your canvas

## Iterating on designs

After AI generates a design, you can refine it with follow-up prompts:

- "Make the heading larger and bold"
- "Add more space between the sections"
- "Change the button to use our brand primary color"
- "Add a footer with links"
- "Move the image to the right side instead"

Each prompt builds on the previous design, so you can iterate quickly.

You can also switch to Design Mode to make manual edits—the AI-generated design is fully editable like any other Subframe design.

## Best practices

### Start broad, then refine

Begin with a high-level description of the page, then use follow-up prompts to refine specific details. This approach is faster than trying to describe everything perfectly in one prompt.

### Use your theme

AI automatically uses your project theme, so you don't need to specify colors, fonts, or spacing scales. Focus on structure and content instead.

### Try multiple variations

Generate 2-4 variations to see different approaches. You might discover layouts or patterns you hadn't considered.

### Reference existing pages

If you have similar pages: "Create a pricing page similar to our features page but with three tiers."

### Iterate gradually

Make small adjustments with follow-up prompts rather than starting over. Each iteration builds on the previous design.

## Tips for better results

**Describe layout patterns** like sidebar, columns, or grid to guide the structure.

**Mention specific components** if you want AI to use particular elements from your library.

**Include content details** — actual text helps AI determine appropriate sizing and layout.

**Set expectations for mood** — professional, playful, elegant, modern, minimal, etc.

**Specify responsive behavior** if you need particular mobile adaptations.

## Limitations

**AI interpretation** — Generated designs may not match your vision exactly. Think of AI as a starting point that gets you 80% there.

**Complexity** — Simpler prompts generally work better. Break complex pages into sections and generate them separately.

**Consistency** — Each generation may vary slightly. If you need exact consistency, generate once and iterate with follow-ups.
