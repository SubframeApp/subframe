title: Personalizing AI
description: Customize how AI generates designs by adding company information and design preferences.

AI Personalization teaches Subframe about your brand, industry, and design preferences through system prompts. The more you build in Subframe, the smarter it gets—your components, pages, theme, and system prompts all train the AI to understand your product.

**Context hierarchy:** AI personalization builds from multiple layers that combine to create on-brand designs:
1. **Theme** — Colors, typography, spacing define your visual language
2. **Components** — Your design system becomes AI's building blocks
3. **System prompts** — Embed product context, design guidelines, brand voice
4. **Existing pages** — Each page you create trains the AI further

## What AI personalization does

When you add context about your company, AI generates:
- Copy that matches your brand voice and industry
- Designs appropriate for your target audience
- Content relevant to your product or service
- Layouts suited to your use case

Without personalization, AI uses generic placeholder content. With it, AI generates designs that feel purpose-built for your brand.

## Setting up personalization

Navigate to **Settings > AI Personalization** from your project.

Add information in these fields:

**Company name** - Your product or company name. AI uses this in generated copy and designs.

**Industry** - Your business sector (SaaS, e-commerce, healthcare, etc.). Helps AI choose appropriate language and examples.

**Description** - What your company does, who you serve, and your key offerings. Be specific—AI pulls from this for copy.

**Brand voice** - How you communicate (professional, friendly, technical, casual). AI matches this tone in generated text.

**Target audience** - Who uses your product. AI tailors language and design complexity to this audience.

Save your settings. AI now uses this context for all generations in this project.

## Example personalization

**Basic system prompt:**
```
Company: Acme Analytics
Industry: B2B SaaS
Description: Data visualization platform for marketing teams
```

Generated hero: "See Your Marketing Data Clearly - Acme Analytics turns complex campaign data into actionable insights for modern marketing teams"

**Advanced system prompt with design guidelines:**
```
Company: Acme Analytics
Industry: B2B SaaS Analytics
Product: Real-time marketing dashboard for campaign analytics

Design System Documentation:
- Cards: Use for metric displays, always include trend indicators
- Page layouts: Default navigation with sidebar for dashboards
- Copy voice: Professional but approachable, data-focused

Key Features:
- Multi-channel campaign tracking
- Real-time ROI calculations
- Automated reporting
- Team collaboration tools
```

This comprehensive system prompt ensures AI generates designs that match your product structure, design patterns, and feature set.

## What AI learns from personalization

**Brand-specific copy** - AI writes content about your actual product instead of generic placeholders.

**Industry language** - Healthcare products get HIPAA-compliant language, fintech gets security emphasis, etc.

**Design system documentation** - Include guidelines for how components are used, default page layouts, and design patterns. AI references these when generating pages.

**Product features** - List key capabilities so AI can create relevant feature sections, use cases, and examples.

**Voice consistency** - Professional brands get formal copy, consumer brands get casual friendly language.

**Audience fit** - Technical products get detailed explanations, consumer products get simple language.

**Cumulative learning** - Every page you create adds to AI's understanding. The system gets trained on all designs you've already made, creating a feedback loop of context.

## Best practices

**Be specific** - "Project management tool for software teams" is better than "productivity app"

**Include design system docs** - Document how your components are used, when to use cards vs lists, default layouts. AI references this when generating pages.

**List key features** - Mention your main capabilities so AI can reference them in generated content.

**Define your audience clearly** - "Small business owners" vs "enterprise IT managers" leads to very different designs.

**Embed comprehensive context** - Think of system prompts like feeding your entire design system documentation and product knowledge base to the AI. More context = better results.

**Update regularly** - Revise personalization as your product or messaging evolves.

**Use actual brand voice** - Don't describe how you want to sound, describe how you actually communicate.

## Personalization per project

Each project has its own AI personalization settings. This lets you:
- Create separate projects for different products
- Test different messaging approaches
- Build client work with their brand info
- Keep experimental projects separate from production

Personalization doesn't sync across projects—set it up for each one.
