AI Personalization teaches Subframe about your brand, industry, and design preferences so generated designs match your style and voice. Add company details once, and AI applies them automatically to every design it creates.

## What AI personalization does

When you add context about your company, AI generates:
- Copy that matches your brand voice and industry
- Designs appropriate for your target audience
- Content relevant to your product or service
- Layouts suited to your use case

Without personalization, AI uses generic placeholder content. With it, AI generates designs that feel purpose-built for your brand.

## Setting up personalization

Navigate to **Settings > AI Personalization** from your project.

Add information in these fields:

**Company name** - Your product or company name. AI uses this in generated copy and designs.

**Industry** - Your business sector (SaaS, e-commerce, healthcare, etc.). Helps AI choose appropriate language and examples.

**Description** - What your company does, who you serve, and your key offerings. Be specific—AI pulls from this for copy.

**Brand voice** - How you communicate (professional, friendly, technical, casual). AI matches this tone in generated text.

**Target audience** - Who uses your product. AI tailors language and design complexity to this audience.

Save your settings. AI now uses this context for all generations in this project.

## Example personalization

**Without personalization:**
> Generic hero: "Get Started Today - The best platform for your needs"

**With personalization:**
> Company: Acme Analytics
> Industry: B2B SaaS
> Description: Data visualization platform for marketing teams
>
> Generated hero: "See Your Marketing Data Clearly - Acme Analytics turns complex campaign data into actionable insights for modern marketing teams"

The personalized version uses your company name, references your specific use case, and speaks to your audience.

## What AI learns from personalization

**Brand-specific copy** - AI writes content about your actual product instead of generic placeholders.

**Industry language** - Healthcare products get HIPAA-compliant language, fintech gets security emphasis, etc.

**Appropriate examples** - AI generates relevant feature lists, testimonials, and use cases for your industry.

**Voice consistency** - Professional brands get formal copy, consumer brands get casual friendly language.

**Audience fit** - Technical products get detailed explanations, consumer products get simple language.

## Best practices

**Be specific** - "Project management tool for software teams" is better than "productivity app"

**Include key features** - Mention your main capabilities so AI can reference them

**Define your audience clearly** - "Small business owners" vs "enterprise IT managers" leads to very different designs

**Update regularly** - Revise personalization as your product or messaging evolves

**Use actual brand voice** - Don't describe how you want to sound, describe how you actually communicate

## Personalization per project

Each project has its own AI personalization settings. This lets you:
- Create separate projects for different products
- Test different messaging approaches
- Build client work with their brand info
- Keep experimental projects separate from production

Personalization doesn't sync across projects—set it up for each one.
