description: Upload images or screenshots and generate matching Subframe designs with AI.
---

Image to Design converts screenshots, mockups, or reference images into editable Subframe designs. Upload an image, describe what you want, and AI generates a matching design using your components and theme.

## How it works

1. Upload an image (screenshot, wireframe, or design reference)
2. Add a text prompt describing what to create
3. AI analyzes the image layout, components, and styling
4. Get 1-4 design variations that match the image
5. Refine with follow-up prompts or manual edits

AI maps the image to Subframe components from your library and applies your theme. It won't create pixel-perfect copies—think of it as translating the image into Subframe's design language.

## Uploading images

In Ask AI mode, click the **image upload button** or drag an image directly into the prompt area.

**Supported formats**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, WebP

**Best image types:**
- Screenshots of web interfaces
- Design mockups or wireframes
- Reference designs you want to recreate
- Competitor pages for inspiration

Clear, high-resolution images work best. Crop to the specific section you want to recreate rather than uploading entire pages.

## Writing prompts with images

Describe your intent when uploading an image. Don't just say "recreate this"—explain what you want.

**Good prompts:**
- "Create a hero section like this image but use our brand colors"
- "Build a dashboard layout matching this structure with our Card components"
- "Make a pricing page similar to this screenshot"
- "Recreate this navigation bar using our existing components"

**Add context:**
- Mention specific components to use
- Specify changes from the original
- Describe responsive behavior if different
- Note which parts to focus on

## Common use cases

**Convert screenshots to Subframe** - Take screenshots of existing apps and recreate them in Subframe with your design system.

**Implement client mockups** - Upload Figma exports, wireframes, or design files and turn them into working Subframe pages.

**Competitor analysis** - Screenshot competitor interfaces and build similar layouts with your branding.

**Reference designs** - Upload inspiration from Dribbble, Behance, or websites and adapt them to your project.

## Refining results

AI-generated designs are starting points. Refine them with:

**Follow-up prompts:**
- "Make the spacing tighter"
- "Use our Button component instead"
- "Add a search bar to the header"
- "Change the layout to two columns"

**Manual editing** - Switch to Design Mode to fine-tune spacing, adjust properties, or swap components.

**Mix variations** - Generate multiple variations and drag elements between them to create your ideal design.

## Best practices

**Crop images to specific sections** - Upload the header, hero, or pricing section separately rather than full pages.

**Provide clear context** - Explain what the image shows and what you want to create from it.

**Set realistic expectations** - AI creates similar designs, not exact replicas. Expect 70-80% accuracy.

**Iterate gradually** - Start with the base layout, then refine details with follow-up prompts.

**Use high-quality images** - Blurry or low-resolution images produce less accurate results.

## Limitations

**Not pixel-perfect** - Generated designs approximate the image but won't match exactly. Fine-tune manually.

**Component constraints** - AI can only use Subframe components. Complex custom elements may not translate well.

**Text accuracy** - OCR sometimes misreads text. Check all copy after generation.

**Complex layouts** - Simpler images work better. Break complex interfaces into smaller sections.
