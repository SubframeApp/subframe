Remix Pages uses AI to create variations of your existing designs. Start with a page you like, describe changes, and generate alternatives—perfect for A/B testing, exploring layouts, or trying different styles.

## How remixing works

AI analyzes your current page design, then generates variations based on your prompt. Unlike starting from scratch, remixing keeps the core structure while adjusting specific aspects.

1. Open an existing page in Ask AI mode
2. Describe the variation you want
3. AI generates alternative designs
4. Compare original and remixed versions
5. Apply the remix or iterate further

## Example remix prompts

**Style variations:**
- "Create a darker version of this page"
- "Make this design more modern and minimal"
- "Try a warmer color palette"
- "Apply a professional corporate style"

**Layout changes:**
- "Move the hero image to the right side"
- "Stack these sections vertically instead"
- "Try a two-column layout"
- "Make this full-width"

**Content adjustments:**
- "Add more whitespace"
- "Include customer testimonials"
- "Add a call-to-action section"
- "Remove the sidebar"

**A/B test variations:**
- "Create a version with the pricing front and center"
- "Try emphasizing different benefits"
- "Generate a simpler, more focused layout"

## Common use cases

**A/B testing** - Generate variations to test which design performs better.

**Style exploration** - Try different aesthetics without starting over.

**Client presentations** - Show multiple options based on the same structure.

**Responsive alternatives** - Generate mobile-optimized layouts from desktop designs.

**Feature variations** - Test pages with and without certain sections or features.

## Tips for better remixes

**Be specific about what to change** - "Make the header darker" is better than "improve this"

**Keep context** - Reference specific sections: "Move the testimonials section above pricing"

**Iterate gradually** - Make one change, see results, then make another

**Generate multiple variations** - Create 2-4 remixes to compare different approaches

**Start from good designs** - Remixing works best when the original page is solid

## Limitations

**Maintains structure** - Remixes adjust your page, they don't redesign it from scratch. For major changes, use Prompt to Design instead.

**Component constraints** - Remixes use existing components. They won't create entirely new UI patterns.

**Fidelity** - Results vary. Some remixes nail the brief, others need refinement.
