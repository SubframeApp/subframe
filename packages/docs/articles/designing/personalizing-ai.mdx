title: Personalizing AI
description: Learn how Subframe AI learns from your designs, components, and custom snippets to create better, on-brand designs.
---

Subframe is the only AI design tool that learns from your designs, allowing you to train and personalize the AI for each project. Four things directly influence AI in your project:

## Design system

Subframe AI uses your existing components and theme by default, so everything stays on brand. Your design system automatically trains the AI to match your established patterns.

## Your pages  

Subframe AI learns from the pages you design, so the more pages you create, the better it gets. Each page becomes part of the AI's understanding of your design preferences.

## Snippets

Snippets are larger, pre-built compositions like page headers, navigation bars, and card layouts that AI references when generating designs. Subframe includes a large library of snippets, but you can also save custom snippets to train AI on your specific design patterns.

## System prompt

Each project has a system prompt to customize AI with context about your product and design guidelines. You can modify the prompt via the [Ask AI](using-ai-to-design#ask-ai) toolbar.
