There are two main ways to add elements to your design in Subframe: quick insert and the insert panel.

## Method 1: Quick insert (recommended)

2. Hover over the edges of the selection box
3. Click the plus button to open the search popup
4. Search for and select the element you want to add
5. The new element will be inserted in the direction you clicked

#### Keyboard shortcuts

- Quick insert above: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd>
- Quick insert below: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd>
- Quick insert left: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd>

1. Click on the Insert tab in the left panel
2. Find the element you want to add
3. Drag it directly onto your canvas

#### Tabs

There are two tabs in the Insert panel:

- **Your library** contains basic elements like text, images, and icons, as well as components like buttons, inputs from your design system.
- **Snippets** contains larger, pre-built compositions like page headers, navigation bars, card layouts, and other complex UI patterns.
