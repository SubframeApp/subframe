Subframe offers three powerful AI-driven ways to accelerate your design process:

- **Ask AI** for generating screen variations
- **Right-click to edit with AI** for making targeted changes
- **Quick Insert with AI** for intelligent element additions

1. Switch to **Ask AI** mode using the toggle group in the top-right corner
2. In the Ask AI panel on the right, describe the screen you want to create
3. Cycle through variations AI generated and either choose:
   - **Apply to current page** to replace your current design
   - **Save as new page** to create a new page with the selected design
4. Continue chatting to refine designs or go back to design mode.

#### Mixing elements between variations

You can drag individual elements from any variation directly onto your canvas. That way you can mix and match elements from different variations to create a new design.
