title: Export to Lovable
---

Subframe generates React code for your designs which you can export directly to [Lovable](/articles/building-ai/export-to-lovable), [Bolt](/articles/building-ai/export-to-bolt), [Replit](/articles/building-ai/export-to-replit), or [Cursor](/articles/building-ai/export-to-cursor) to speed up development. 

Lovable offers a bit less code flexibility than some of their competitors, so we leverage their Github integration to set up Subframe.
