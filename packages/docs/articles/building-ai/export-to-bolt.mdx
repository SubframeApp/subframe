title: Export to Bolt
---

Subframe generates React code for your designs which you can export directly to [Bolt](/articles/building-ai/export-to-bolt), [Replit](/articles/building-ai/export-to-replit), [Cursor](/articles/building-ai/export-to-cursor), or [Lovable](/articles/building-ai/export-to-lovable) to speed up development. We've created prompts optimized for Bolt, or you can export manually.

### Open Code Mode
1. Click **Code** in the top right of your page to open **Code Mode**.
2. Select **Export to Bolt**.

### Set up your Bolt project
To sync your Subframe components with Bolt, you'll need to install it for your project. If you're starting fresh, we recommend using the **Bolt Vite template**, but you can use any framework you prefer.

1. Go to the **Setup your Bolt project** section in **Code Mode**.
2. Click **Open Bolt** to create a new Vite app.
3. Click **Generate Bolt Prompt** â€” this will create an installation prompt that sets up Subframe and installs any required dependencies.
4. Copy the generated prompt and paste it into **Bolt chat** to run the setup.

### Export your design to Bolt
You can export an entire page or a specific selection from Subframe to Bolt.

1. Copy the **Export to Bolt** prompt and paste it into **Bolt chat**. This will sync your components and copy over your design code.
2. In Bolt, modify the prompt as needed to:
    * Create a new page
    * Update an existing page
    * [Add additional logic or connections](/articles/developing/adding-business-logic)

Once exported, your design is ready to build on, connect to a backend, or deploy to production.
