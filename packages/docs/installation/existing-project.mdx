title: Install in existing codebase
description: Add Subframe to your existing React + Tailwind project.
---

You can add Subframe to any existing project that uses TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. The CLI will configure your project automatically, syncing components and theme tokens to your codebase.

<Note>
Subframe works with any framework that uses TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before installing Subframe, make sure your project has:

- **TypeScript** — Subframe components are fully typed
- **React** (version 16.8 or higher) — Hooks support required
- **Tailwind CSS** (v3 or v4) — For styling components

Subframe works with Next.js, Vite, Astro, Remix, and any other React framework.

## Installation steps

### Run the init command

Run the following command in the root of your repository:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npx @subframe/cli@latest init
  ```
  ```bash yarn
  yarn dlx @subframe/cli@latest init
  ```
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpx @subframe/cli@latest init
  ```
  ```bash bun
  bunx @subframe/cli@latest init
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Authenticate with your access token

The CLI will prompt you to authenticate. Visit the URL shown and copy your access token:

```
> No existing credentials found.
> To get new credentials, please visit the following URL in your web browser:
> https://app.subframe.com/cli/auth

> You will need to login then enter the provided credentials below.
? Access token ›
```

Paste your access token and press Enter.

### Configure your installation

Answer a few questions to configure Subframe. Press Enter to accept the defaults:

```
Where should the Subframe components be synced to? › ./src
Configure an alias for the subframe component directory (e.g. @/ui) › @/ui/*
Do you want Subframe to configure your Tailwind config? › (Y/n)
Would you like to sync all of your Subframe components? › (Y/n)
Would you like to install dependencies? › (Y/n)
Would you like to start the dev server? › (Y/n)
```

The CLI will:
- Sync components to your specified directory
- Configure your Tailwind config with theme tokens
- Install required dependencies
- Optionally sync all components and start your dev server

## Verify your installation

Test that Subframe is working by importing a component in your code:

```tsx App.tsx
import { Button } from "@/ui/Button";

export default function App() {
  return <Button>Click me</Button>;
}
```

If the button renders with proper styling, you're all set!

## Framework-specific guidance

Some frameworks require additional configuration. Refer to the guide for your framework if you encounter issues:

## Troubleshooting

### Tailwind styles not applying

If your components render but don't have proper styling:

1. Verify your Tailwind config includes the Subframe theme preset
2. Make sure your content paths include the Subframe component directory
3. Check that Tailwind is processing your CSS correctly

See [Tailwind config](/develop/tailwind-config) for more details.

### Component import errors

If you get import errors:

1. Check that the alias in your `tsconfig.json` matches the one you configured during setup
2. Verify components synced correctly by checking your component directory
3. Try running `npx @subframe/cli sync --all` to re-sync components

### TypeScript errors

If you see TypeScript errors in Subframe components:

1. Make sure your project uses TypeScript (not JavaScript)
2. Verify `@types/react` is installed
3. Check that your `tsconfig.json` includes the component directory
