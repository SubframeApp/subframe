title: Set up new project
description: Start a new project with Subframe using one of our optimized starter templates for Next.js, Vite, or Astro.
---

Starting a new project with Subframe is the fastest way to get up and running. Our starter templates come pre-configured with TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, and Subframe—everything you need to start building.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
- A package manager: **npm**, **yarn**, **pnpm**, or **bun**
- A **Subframe account** — [Sign up for free](https://app.subframe.com)

## Create a new project

Run the following command in your terminal to start the installation:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npx @subframe/cli@latest init
  ```
  ```bash yarn
  yarn dlx @subframe/cli@latest init
  ```
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpx @subframe/cli@latest init
  ```
  ```bash bun
  bunx @subframe/cli@latest init
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The CLI will guide you through the setup process.

### Choose a framework

When prompted, select whether you want to start a new project or add Subframe to an existing one:

```
? Would you like to start a new project? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯   Next.js
    Vite
    Astro
```

Each template is optimized to work seamlessly with Subframe:

- **Next.js** — App Router setup with server and client components
- **Vite** — Fast development with instant HMR
- **Astro** — Content-focused sites with island architecture

### Authenticate with your access token

The CLI will prompt you to authenticate. Copy your access token from your browser:

```
> No existing credentials found.
> To get new credentials, please visit the following URL in your web browser:
> https://app.subframe.com/cli/auth

> You will need to login then enter the provided credentials below.
? Access token ›
```

Paste your access token and press Enter.

### Configure your project

You'll be asked a few configuration questions. You can press Enter to accept the defaults:

```
Where should the Subframe components be synced to? › ./src
Configure an alias for the subframe component directory (e.g. @/ui) › @/ui/*
Do you want Subframe to configure your Tailwind config? › (Y/n)
Would you like to sync all of your Subframe components? › (Y/n)
Would you like to install dependencies? › (Y/n)
Would you like to start the dev server? › (Y/n)
```

The CLI will:
- Create your project from the selected template
- Sync your Subframe components to the specified directory
- Configure Tailwind with your theme tokens
- Install all dependencies
- Optionally start the development server

## What gets installed

Your new project includes:

**Subframe components** — All components from your project sync to the configured directory (default: `./src/ui/`).

**Tailwind configuration** — Theme tokens (colors, typography, spacing) sync to your `tailwind.config.js` or `theme.css` depending on your Tailwind version.

**Dependencies** — The CLI installs required packages including Radix UI primitives, Tailwind CSS, and other dependencies.

**TypeScript configuration** — Your project is set up with TypeScript and includes all necessary type definitions.

## Next steps

Your project is ready! Here's what to do next:

1. **Open the editor** — Visit [app.subframe.com](https://app.subframe.com) and start designing
2. **Explore the template** — Look at the example pages and components included in your starter
3. **Learn the workflow** — Check out [Syncing components](/develop/syncing-components) to understand how changes flow from Subframe to your codebase

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues during installation, refer to the framework-specific guide for your project or the [Manual installation guide](/installation/framework-guides/manual) for detailed steps.
