Start a new project with Subframe using templates for Next.js, Vite, or Astro. Templates include TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, and Subframe—everything you need to build.

## Create project

Run the init command in a new folder:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npx @subframe/cli@latest init
  ```
  ```bash yarn
  yarn dlx @subframe/cli@latest init
  ```
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpx @subframe/cli@latest init
  ```
  ```bash bun
  bunx @subframe/cli@latest init
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Choose framework

Select your framework when prompted:

```
? Would you like to start a new project? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯   Next.js
    Vite
    Astro
```

Each template is optimized for Subframe:

- **Next.js** — App Router with server and client components
- **Vite** — Fast development with instant HMR
- **Astro** — Content-focused sites with island architecture

### Authenticate

Paste your access token from [app.subframe.com/cli/auth](https://app.subframe.com/cli/auth):

```
> No existing credentials found.
> To get new credentials, please visit the following URL in your web browser:
> https://app.subframe.com/cli/auth

? Access token ›
```

### Configure

Answer a few questions. Press Enter for defaults:

```
Where should the Subframe components be synced to? › ./src
Configure an alias for the subframe component directory (e.g. @/ui) › @/ui/*
Do you want Subframe to configure your Tailwind config? › (Y/n)
Would you like to sync all of your Subframe components? › (Y/n)
Would you like to install dependencies? › (Y/n)
Would you like to start the dev server? › (Y/n)
```

The CLI creates your project, syncs components, configures Tailwind, installs dependencies, and optionally starts the dev server.

## What gets installed

- **Components** — All components from your Subframe project sync to `./src/ui/`
- **Theme** — Design tokens sync to your Tailwind config
- **Dependencies** — Radix UI primitives, Tailwind CSS, and required packages
- **TypeScript** — Full type definitions included
