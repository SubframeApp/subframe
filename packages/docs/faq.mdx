  <Accordion title="Can I import my existing component library?">
    If you have existing components in your codebase already, you can import them into Subframe.

    Note: This feature is in a limited beta and not available for everyone. If you're interested in early access, reach out to support@subframe.com

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does Subframe integrate with Bolt/Replit/Cursor/Lovable?">
    You can export your Subframe components and pages to [Bolt](/ai/export-to-bolt), [Replit](/ai/export-to-replit), [Cursor](/ai/export-to-cursor), and [Lovable](/ai/export-to-lovable).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I add logic to my Subframe components?">
    We recommend wrapping your Subframe components in your own logical components. This way, you can make changes to the component without having to unsync them. For more information, see the [Adding Business Logic](/developing/adding-business-logic) page.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why do I not see my pages in my codebase after I sync?">
    Pages often require refactoring and additional business logic after export. For that reason, pages are never synced via CLI and always copy / pasted. For more information, see [Copy & paste pages](/developing/copy-paste-pages).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will my code keep working if I cancel my subscription?">
    All of your code is synced to your codebase and yours to keep. The libraries that Subframe components depend on are [open source](https://github.com/SubframeApp/subframe) and will remain available should you cancel your subscription or if Subframe were to shut down.

  <Accordion title="Can I import my designs from Figma?">
    You can copy your Figma pages as PNGs and ask Subframe AI to recreate the design in Subframe.
