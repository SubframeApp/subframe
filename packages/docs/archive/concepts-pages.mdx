description: Individual screens or views in your application that you design in the Subframe editor.

Each design you create in Subframe functions as a page—an individual screen or view in your application. Pages are where you combine components, add content, and design the actual interface your users will see.

## Creating a new page

To add a new page from the editor:

1. Click the **Pages** tab in the left panel
2. Click the **+** button
3. Select a template or start from scratch

![The Pages panel showing a list of pages with a "+" button at the top. Template options appear in a modal including "Blank page", "Dashboard", "Landing page", and "Settings page".]

New pages appear at the top of your pages list. You can also **duplicate** existing pages by right-clicking any page and selecting duplicate—this creates a copy directly below the current page.

## Managing your pages

The **Pages** tab in the left panel gives you a complete view of all pages in your project. From here you can:

- **Search** for pages by name
- **Switch** between pages by clicking any page
- **Reorder** pages by dragging the handles that appear on hover
- **Organize** pages into flows for better structure

The order you set here determines how pages appear when you browse your full project.

## Page structure

### Page canvas

The canvas is your design surface—an infinite workspace where you can add and arrange components. The canvas is responsive by default, showing a desktop view with a mobile breakpoint you can toggle to design for smaller screens.

### Page layouts

Pages can use different layout types that affect how they appear in your application:

**Default layout** — A standard full-page view that takes up the entire viewport.

**Dialog layout** — Centers the page content in a modal overlay with a backdrop. Use this for forms, confirmations, or focused interactions.

**Drawer layout** — Slides the page content in from the side (left or right). Common for navigation menus or detail panels.

You can change the page layout from the page settings in the top-right of the editor.

## Exporting pages to code

Unlike components, **pages are not synced automatically** to your codebase via the CLI. This is intentional—pages often require refactoring and business logic integration after export.

Instead, you **copy and paste** page code from the editor directly into your project:

1. Switch to **Code Mode** in the top-right
2. Click **Copy code**
3. Paste the code into your project file
4. Add state management, API calls, and business logic as needed

For more details, see [Exporting code](/develop/exporting-code) and [Adding business logic](/develop/adding-business-logic).
