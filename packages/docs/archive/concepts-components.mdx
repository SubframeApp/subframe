Components are reusable UI building blocks that you design once and use throughout your project. When you create or modify a component in Subframe, those changes sync automatically to your codebase—update the design, and the code updates too.

## Types of components

**Built-in components** — Subframe provides a library of pre-built components like buttons, inputs, cards, and navigation elements. These components follow design system best practices and are ready to use out of the box.

**Custom components** — You can create your own components from scratch or by converting existing designs. Custom components work exactly like built-in ones—they sync to your codebase and can be reused across pages.

**External components (BYOC)** — Bring Your Own Components from npm packages or your existing codebase. Import them into Subframe to use alongside built-in and custom components.

<Note>
This feature is in limited beta and not available for everyone. If you're interested in early access, reach out to support@subframe.com.

## Component anatomy

Components have several features that make them flexible and powerful:

**Props** — Simple values like text, colors, or icons that customize component instances. For example, a button component might have props for label text, size, and color.

**Variants** — Pre-configured versions of a component, like size options (small, medium, large) or style variations (primary, secondary, ghost).

**States** — Visual changes based on user interaction, including hover, pressed, focused, and disabled states.

**Slots** — Placeholders for React children that let you nest components inside each other. Slots enable composition patterns like adding an icon to a button or custom content in a card.

## Using components

### Adding components to your design

1. Click the **Components** tab in the left panel
2. Search for or browse to find a component
3. Drag the component onto your canvas

Components appear as instances—copies linked to the original. Change the source component, and all instances update automatically.

### Viewing component documentation

To see what props a component accepts and how to use it in code:

1. Navigate to the **Components** tab in the top navigation
2. Select any component
3. View the documentation panel showing React props, TypeScript interfaces, and code examples

All components accept standard React DOM props like `onClick` and `className` in addition to their custom props.

## How components sync to code

When you run `npx @subframe/cli sync`, Subframe exports your components as TypeScript React code. Each component becomes a `.tsx` file in your codebase with:

- Full TypeScript types for props
- Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- Radix UI primitives for accessibility (when applicable)
- Support for all React patterns like refs, children, and event handlers

Components sync **one-way** from Subframe to your codebase. Changes made in Subframe overwrite the generated files, but you should never edit these files directly—wrap them in your own components instead.
