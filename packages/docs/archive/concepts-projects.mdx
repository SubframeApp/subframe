description: Organize your work into projects, each with its own theme, components, and pages.
---

Projects enable you to organize work into separate workspaces within a single Subframe account. Each project maintains its own theme, custom components, and page designs.

Use projects to manage different client work, separate professional from personal projects, or experiment with new concepts without affecting your main work.

<Note>
Projects are currently shared with everyone on your team, so all team members can view and edit them.

## What's in a project?

Each project contains everything you need to build a cohesive application:

**Theme** — Your design tokens including colors, typography, spacing, shadows, and border radius. The theme applies to all components and pages in the project.

**Components** — Both built-in components from Subframe's library and any custom components you create. Components are scoped to each project.

**Pages** — Individual screens or views you design in the editor. Pages can be organized into flows for better project structure.

**Flows** — Groups of related pages that represent user journeys or feature areas. Use flows to organize pages by product area, status, or feature state.

## Creating a new project

You begin with a default project when you join Subframe. To create additional projects:

1. Click the **Project Switcher** in the top-left navigation
2. Select **+ New project**
3. Enter a project name
4. Click **Create**

You can also navigate to **Project Settings** by clicking your avatar in the top-right and selecting **Manage projects**, then click **+ New**.

**All team members have access** — Projects are shared with everyone on your team. Individual project permissions are not yet available.
