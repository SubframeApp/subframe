Flows help you organize page designs into groups as your project scales. Think of flows as folders for related pages—they make it easier to find specific pages and understand the structure of your application.

## How to organize with flows

There are several ways to use flows effectively:

**By product area** — Group pages that belong to the same feature area, like Onboarding, Settings, or Dashboard.

**By status** — Organize pages based on their development state, such as In Progress, Ready for Dev, or Completed.

**By feature state** — Separate different states of the same feature, like Empty State, Error State, or Loading State.

Choose the organization method that makes the most sense for your team and project.

## Creating and managing flows

You can create new flows from either the **Pages** section in your dashboard or the **Pages** panel in the editor.

To create a flow:

1. Click the **Pages** tab in the left panel
2. Click the **•••** menu next to "Pages"
3. Select **New flow**
4. Name your flow

### Renaming flows

You can rename a flow at any time by clicking the **•••** menu next to the flow name and selecting **Rename**.

### Reordering flows

Drag the handles that appear when you hover over a flow name to reposition flows. Pages that aren't in any flow always appear at the top of your pages list.

### Adding pages to flows

To add a page to a flow, drag the page and drop it into the flow. You can also:

- Create a new page directly inside a flow by clicking the **+** button next to the flow name
- Right-click a page and select **Move to flow**

## Previewing flows

Preview mode lets you create simple prototypes by navigating through pages in a flow sequentially. This is useful for sharing your designs with stakeholders or testing user journeys.

To preview a flow:

1. Click the **Preview** button in the top-right of the editor
2. Navigate through pages using the arrow buttons or by clicking linked elements

<Note>
It's not currently possible to link flows together or create advanced prototyping features like conditional navigation. For AI-powered prototyping with custom interactions, see [Prototype Mode](/editor/prototype-mode/overview).
