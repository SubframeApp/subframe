## Introduction

Users can modify their Subframe projects to align with their brand identity. The theming system applies across all design system components and styles within the platform.

## Update Project Theme

The platform offers pre-selected theme colors and styles for quick customization. Users access this feature by:

1. Opening Subframe and selecting the **Components** tab
2. Clicking **Theme** in the left sidebar
3. Clicking the **Edit theme** button
4. Selecting desired theming options (changes apply automatically)

## Update Individual Tokens

Tokens enable reusable styling elements like colors, typography, and border radiuses. Modifying a token once updates it across all components and pages.

Steps to update tokens:

1. Navigate to **Components > Theme**
2. Select the token to edit
3. Modify as needed (auto-saves)

## Create Custom Color Tokens

Subframe includes semantic color tokens for text, borders, and backgrounds. Users can create custom tokens by:

1. Going to **Components > Theme**
2. Clicking the **+** button near existing tokens
3. Naming the token
4. Setting its value via hex code or referencing existing tokens

<Warning>
When you delete a custom token, all references where it is used will be updated to the hex code color.
</Warning>
