title: Organizing pages using flows
description: Flows help you organize your pages into groups
---

## Overview

Flows help you organize page designs into groups when projects scale. Three organizational approaches are suggested:

- Organizing by product area (like Onboarding or Settings)
- By status (such as In Progress or Ready for Dev)
- By feature state (empty, error, or loading states)

## Creating Flows

New flows can be created from the Pages section or the Pages panel in the editor.

## Renaming Flows

Flow names are editable from multiple locations within the interface.

## Reordering Flows

Drag handles enable repositioning flows. Pages outside flows always appear at the top.

## Adding Pages

Pages can be added to flow ends or via menu options.

## Previewing Flows

Preview mode allows simple prototype creation with navigation between pages in sequence.

<Note>
It's not currently possible to link flows or pages together for advanced prototyping features.
