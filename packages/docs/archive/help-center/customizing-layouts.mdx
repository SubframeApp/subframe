## Overview

Layouts are a powerful way to reuse common elements like sidebars / navbars across multiple pages. You can also use layouts to create dialogs and drawers.

## Adding a Layout to Your Page

Each page supports four layout options:

- No layout
- Default layout — for navigational elements
- Dialog layout — for modals over existing content
- Drawer layout — for right-side drawers with extra details

**Steps to add a layout:**

1. Open your page with nothing selected
2. Click the desired layout option under **Page Layout** on the right sidebar

## Customizing the Default Layout

To add a sidebar or navbar:

1. Open any page
2. Click the pencil icon in **Page Layout > Default**
3. Select **Choose layout template**
4. Choose a sidebar or navbar layout
5. Click **Apply layout** to implement it

From here, you can continue editing your layout such as changing the text or adding new items.
