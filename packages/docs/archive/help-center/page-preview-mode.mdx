## Overview

The preview feature displays page designs in a browser environment mirroring their final code appearance. This tool facilitates testing of interactions, scrolling, and responsive behavior while enabling basic prototype creation through page navigation.

## Preview Page Flows

All pages exist within a unified flow, allowing sequential navigation via keyboard shortcuts.

**Access Methods:**

1. Click the **Preview** button (top-right of editor) to begin from the current page, OR access via the **Pages** tab and select the Play icon to start from the first page
2. Navigate between pages using toolbar arrows or arrow keys on your keyboard
3. Exit by clicking the **X** icon or pressing <kbd>Escape</kbd>

**Additional Feature:** Users can minimize the toolbar by clicking the minimize icon for distraction-free viewing; hovering near the screen bottom restores visibility.

## Share Public Preview Links

Individual page previews enable sharing through public links, allowing unrestricted browser access without login requirements.

**Steps to Enable Sharing:**

1. Click the **Share** button (top-right editor)
2. Toggle **Anyone with the link can view**
3. Copy and distribute the link

<Note>
Preview links are enabled on a page-by-page basis. You can disable sharing at anytime by toggling off the switch for a page.
