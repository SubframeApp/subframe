## Introduction

Subframe provides a customizable design system exported as React code. Developers can enhance exported components with business logic. To understand available React props, users should access the component documentation.

## View Docs for a Component

The process involves three steps:

1. Open Subframe and click the **Components** tab in the top navigation
2. Select the desired component from either the left sidebar or middle panel
3. Access documentation showing React props, source code, and interactive examples

<Tip>
All components accept React DOM props like `onClick` and `className`.

## View Interactive Examples

Some component documentation includes interactive examples for copying and pasting:

1. Open Subframe and select the **Components** tab
2. Choose a component from the sidebar or middle area
3. Scroll to the **Examples** section
4. Click **View code** to examine example code (fully editable)
