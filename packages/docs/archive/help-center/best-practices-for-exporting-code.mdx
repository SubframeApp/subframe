title: Best practices for exporting code
description: Guide for integrating Subframe designs into codebases
---

## Overview

Subframe employs a copy-paste workflow rather than hosted solutions. Three key principles:

1. **Components vs. Pages:** Components are synced, pages are copy / pasted. Components serve as the design system source of truth via CLI synchronization, while pages require manual copying due to business logic needs.

2. **Flexibility:** Teams shouldn't worry about "correct" usage—if it saves time, you're using it right. Not everything must exist in Subframe.

3. **Source Code Access:** The platform provides complete source code built on open-source libraries like Radix, available as SubframeCore on GitHub. This prevents vendor lock-in and enables custom workarounds.

## Adding Business Logic

### Key Principle

Business logic...belongs in code, not a design tool. Subframe omits application logic from exports, handling only UI interactions like accordion animations.

### For Pages

1. Open the Code tab (top-right)
2. Copy/paste CLI commands for component syncing
3. Copy/paste complete page code
4. Refactor and add business logic as needed

### For Components

**Recommended Approach:** Wrap components with business logic in new wrapper components. Subframe components forward props to root elements, allowing onClick handlers and other React properties without breaking synchronization.

**Alternative:** Disable sync by adding `// @subframe/sync-disable` at file top, though subsequent changes require manual syncing.

## Code Example

```typescript
import * as SubframeCore from "@subframe/core";
import React from "react";
import { Button } from "./subframe/components/Button";

interface CustomButtonProps
  extends React.ComponentProps<typeof SubframeCore.Button.Root> {
  // Add your custom props here
}

const CustomButton = React.forwardRef<
  HTMLElement,
  CustomButtonProps
>(function CustomButton({ children, ...otherProps }: CustomButtonProps, ref) {
  // Add your business logic here

  return (
    <Button ref={ref as any} {...otherProps}>
      {children}
    </Button>
  );
});

export { CustomButton };
```
