## Overview

Subframe leverages CSS flexbox for layout management. The platform translates CSS properties like `flex-direction` and `gap` into intuitive UI controls. A key principle: **most layout properties are updated from the parent, not the child.** For instance, spacing between elements requires selecting their parent container.

## Change Direction

Child elements within a stack can be arranged vertically or horizontally. To modify direction:

1. Select the stack
2. Click **Vertical / Horizontal** under **Layout** in the right sidebar

## Allow Contents to Wrap

When a stack contains more elements than available space permits, wrapping can be enabled to flow items to the next line.

Steps to toggle wrapping:

1. Select the stack
2. Click **Layout > ...** to open the wrap menu
3. Toggle **Wrap / No wrap**

## Update Space Between Elements

To adjust spacing between all stack elements:

1. Select the stack
2. Select a spacing size under **Layout > Space between children**
3. Click **Space between children > ...** for advanced options including a **Fill** setting

<Tip>
Target specific element pairs by wrapping them in a separate stack.
</Tip>

## Update Alignment

Both vertical and horizontal alignment can be customized. Select the stack, then choose your preferred alignment from the alignment selector.

## Common Alignment Issues

- Elements need wrapping in a stack to have individual alignment
- Stacks require **Width > Fill** or **Height > Fill** to create space for alignment to take effect
