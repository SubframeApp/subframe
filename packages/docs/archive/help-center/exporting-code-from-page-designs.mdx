title: Exporting code from page designs
description: Generate React + Tailwind CSS code for your designs

## Overview

Subframe generates React + Tailwind CSS code for designs. Users can sync project themes and components, then copy-paste page designs into codebases while maintaining pixel-perfect UI accuracy.

## Main Process

### 1. Sync Project via CLI

- Click **Sync code** in the top-right navigation
- Copy and execute the unique sync command in your CLI
- Re-sync after making theme or component changes

### 2. Copy & Paste Page Code

- Open the page editor and select **Code** in top navigation
- View code for entire pages or individual selected elements
- The code panel displays installation snippets, import statements, and generated React + Tailwind CSS code
- Expand the panel using the expand icon

### 3. Customize Business Logic

- Refactor the generated code as needed
- Add custom business logic and API connections
- Components expose standard React props like `onClick` and `className`
- Special components like Accordion include unique props for internal behavior

## Design Updates

If designs change post-export, re-export only modified sections. Most users complete all design iterations in Subframe before exporting to minimize re-exports.
