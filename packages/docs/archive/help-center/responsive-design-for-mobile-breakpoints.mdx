title: Responsive design for mobile breakpoints
description: Implement mobile-responsive design using desktop and mobile breakpoints
---

## Overview

The platform uses desktop-first responsive design starting at the Desktop breakpoint by default. Users access the Mobile breakpoint through the **Breakpoint** menu in the page editor's top-right corner.

## Switching Breakpoints

Users can toggle between Desktop and Mobile breakpoints from the Breakpoint menu in the top-right corner of the page editor.

## Adding Mobile Overrides

When editing at the Mobile breakpoint, designers can customize styling for mobile devices including:

- Text styles
- Colors
- Sizing
- Layout
- Padding
- Borders
- Shadows
- Visibility

A purple override indicator marks modified styles, and a phone icon appears in the layers panel to track which elements have mobile-specific changes.

## Resetting Mobile Overrides

Individual styles can be reset by clicking their purple indicators, or all mobile styles for an element can be removed via right-click menu options.

## Code Export Details

The exported code uses the `mobile:` prefix for style overrides, applying to viewports under 767px wide through media queries. This generates responsive React and Tailwind code automatically.

## Current Limitations

Custom breakpoints aren't currently available. Users needing different breakpoint configurations should contact support@subframe.com.
