## Introduction

Projects enable users to organize work into separate workspaces within a single Subframe account. Each project maintains its own theme, custom components, and page designs. This feature supports multiple use cases: managing different client work, separating professional from personal projects, or experimenting with new concepts.

<Note>
Projects are currently shared with everyone on your team, so all team members will be able to view and edit them.

## Create a New Project

Users begin with a default project upon joining. To create additional projects:
