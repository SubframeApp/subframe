description: How to create a component from scratch

## Overview

Components serve as reusable UI building blocks. Beyond Subframe's built-in design system components, users can develop custom components shared across design and code environments.

<Note>
Whenever you create new components, run the CLI command to sync your changes with your codebase.

## Create a Component

### From Existing Design

The process involves:

1. Selecting layers for inclusion
2. Right-clicking the selection
3. Choosing **Create component** from the dropdown
4. Naming the component and selecting suggested properties
5. Accessing the component editor for further refinement

### From Scratch

1. Navigate to the component library
2. Click **+ New component**
3. Subframe creates a blank component and opens the editor

## Component Properties

Properties enable:
- Changing icons, text, or images
- Creating component variants
- Adding custom elements via slots

### Suggested Properties

When creating from existing layers, Subframe recommends properties. Users can rename properties using text fields and remove unnecessary ones via toggle switches.
