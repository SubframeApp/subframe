## Introduction

Each design created in Subframe functions as a page. Users can manage multiple pages through the **Pages** tab in the left panel, where they can search for, switch between, reorder, and create new pages.

## Creating a New Page

To add a new page from the editor:

1. Click the **Pages** tab in the left panel
2. Click the **+** button
3. Select a template or start from scratch

The system adds new pages to the top of the list. Users can also duplicate existing pages, which creates a copy below the current page.

## Reordering Pages

Page organization works through drag-and-drop functionality:

1. Click the **Pages** tab in the left panel
2. Hover over a page to reveal drag handles
3. Use drag-and-drop to reorder pages

The order you set in the Pages tab of the editor will be shown when you browse all Pages.
