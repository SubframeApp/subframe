## Overview

Slots represent a powerful mechanism in Subframe for reusing React components while circumventing prop drilling. These allow developers to pass elements or components as properties, aligning with the React composition pattern approach.

## When to Use Slots

Implement slots for components that feature:
- Dynamic content (e.g., social media cards displaying text, images, or video)
- Interactive elements such as buttons

## How Slots Export to Code

Slots function similarly to React's `children` props. Here's an example:

```tsx
<Card
  title="Product name"
  callToAction={
    <Button variant="brand-primary" onClick={...}>Add to cart</Button>
  }
>
  <ProductImage />
</Card>
```

Key points:
- The `children` slot displays flexible content (ProductImage, video, text, etc.)
- The `callToAction` slot enables customized buttons with event handlers without prop drilling

## Creating a Slot

Only stacks can function as slots. The creation process involves:

1. Create a stack by grouping elements
2. Select the stack
3. Click the **+** button labeled **Slot** on the right panel
4. Alternatively, right-click any stack and select **Add Slot**

## Using a Slot

1. Select the component containing a slot
2. Click **Edit slot contents**
3. Double-click slot contents for direct editing
