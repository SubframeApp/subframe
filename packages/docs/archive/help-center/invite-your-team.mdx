## Overview

Team members can be invited to access shared projects. Once invited, teammates gain access to your project's theme, components, and real-time design editor.

## Instructions for Inviting Teammates

The process involves four steps:

1. Navigate to **Team Settings** by clicking the user avatar in the top-right corner and selecting the invite option
2. Click the **Invite** button
3. Input the prospective team member's email address
4. Send the invitation, which triggers an email allowing them to join

<Warning>
Every account can only be part of one team. If you need help transferring an account to a different team, reach out to support@subframe.com
