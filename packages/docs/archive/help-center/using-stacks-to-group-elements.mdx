## Overview

You can use Stacks to reposition child elements relative to each other. Users have two options for creating stacks: adding empty stacks directly or wrapping existing elements by grouping them together.

## Instructions for Grouping Elements

To group multiple elements with a stack, follow these steps:

1. **Select multiple elements** by holding down <kbd>Shift</kbd> and clicking on them
2. Press <kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd> to apply the grouping

Your elements should now be wrapped in a new stack.
