title: Copy & paste pages
---

As we saw in [Syncing components](/syncing-components), most people use Subframe as the source of truth for their design system. This is why we recommend using the Subframe CLI to sync changes to components to your codebase.

Pages, however, often require refactoring and additional business logic after export. For that reason, pages are never synced via the Subframe CLI and always copy / pasted.

1. Open the page editor.
2. Select Code in the top-right of the nav to open the code panel.
3. By default, the code panel will show the code for the entire page. You can select individual elements on the page to see a code snippet for your selection.
4. The code panel will show the following for each page or selection:
    1. Snippet to install/sync components.
    2. List of imports.
    3. Generated React + Tailwind CSS code.
5. Copy & paste the code to your code editor.

### Add your business logic

Most users from here begin to refactor the code, add custom business logic, and hook it up to their APIs. This code is all yours to customize!

### What if I change the design after exporting the page?

You will need to re-export just the parts that have changed. To make this easier, if you have something selected, the Code tab will show just the code for your selection.

In practice, most Subframe users do all design iterations on Subframe and rarely re-export older pages. For small changes, some find it easier to just make the changes in code.
