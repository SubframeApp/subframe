description: Understand Subframe's theme system built on design tokens and Tailwind CSS.
---

Your theme is the foundation of your design system—a collection of design tokens that define colors, typography, spacing, borders, and shadows across your entire project.

## What are design tokens?

Design tokens are reusable style values that create consistency across your application. Instead of hardcoding colors or font sizes throughout your components, you define them once in your theme and reference them everywhere.

When you update a token—like changing your brand color from blue to purple—every component using that token updates automatically.

## Token categories

Subframe themes include five main categories of tokens:

**Colors** — Brand colors, neutral grays, and semantic colors like error, warning, and success. Also includes colors for default text, backgrounds, and borders.

**Typography** — Font families, sizes, weights, line heights, and letter spacing for headings, body text, captions, and code.

**Spacing** — Values for padding, margins, and gaps. Includes Tailwind's default spacing scale (0-96) plus custom values.

**Borders** — Border radius values from sharp corners (sm) to fully rounded (full).

**Shadows** — Pre-configured shadow presets for elevation, from subtle (sm) to prominent (overlay).

## How themes work with Tailwind

Your theme exports as Tailwind CSS configuration. When you sync your components, Subframe generates a `tailwind.config.js` (Tailwind v3) or `theme.css` (Tailwind v4) file with all your design tokens.

This means your components use standard Tailwind classes like `text-brand-primary` or `text-heading-2`—but the actual values come from your Subframe theme. Update your theme in Subframe, re-sync your components, and your entire application updates.

For more details, see [Tailwind config](/develop/tailwind-config).

## Accessing your theme

To view or edit your theme:

1. Click the **Components** tab in the top navigation
2. Select **Theme** from the left sidebar
3. Use the **Edit theme** button to quickly apply pre-configured theme styles, or edit individual tokens directly

All changes save automatically and apply immediately to components in your project.
