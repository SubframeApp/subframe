title: Syncing components
description: Keep your design system in sync between Subframe and your codebase.
---

Subframe is the single source of truth for your design system. Components you build in Subframe sync directly to your codebase — same code, same behavior.

## Using the CLI

Sync all components to your codebase with the CLI:

```bash
npx @subframe/cli sync --all
```

To sync specific components:

```bash
npx @subframe/cli sync Button Alert Accordion
```

The CLI pulls all components into your configured directory in your [project settings](/learn/projects/project-settings).

### Import alias

The import alias (e.g., `@/subframe`) determines how components reference each other in the generated code. When you run `npx @subframe/cli init`, the CLI detects your project's TypeScript path aliases and prompts you to confirm before updating your Subframe project settings.

You can also specify an alias directly with the `--alias` flag:

```bash
npx @subframe/cli init --alias @/ui
```

Note that **sync is one-way** from Subframe to your codebase. Local changes to synced files will be overwritten on the next sync. If you don't want to overwrite local changes, you can [disable sync](/concepts/syncing-components#disabling-sync) for the component. In the future, we'll support syncing code changes back to Subframe.

## Adding business logic

Subframe components are presentational — they handle layout, styling, and UI interactions like accordion open/close, but avoid adding product-specific application logic like API calls or state management.

Under the hood, we use [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/) for interactive behavior, which gives you accessible, well-tested interactions out of the box.

### Adding handlers and attributes

All components pass through props to the top-level element. This means you can add `data-*` attributes, `tabIndex`, `onClick`, or any other standard HTML attribute directly to any component.

```tsx
<Button onClick={handleSubmit} tabIndex={0} data-testid="submit-btn">
  Submit
</Button>
```

### Using slots to access nested props

It's common for components to contain interactive elements within them—like a card with a button. Slots let you access these nested elements' props:

```tsx
import { TrackCard } from "@/ui/components/TrackCard"

function MyTrackCard({ onFavorite }) {
  return (
    <TrackCard
      title="Song Title"
      artist="Artist Name"
      // Slots let you access nested props, without top-level object props
      // [!code highlight:8]
      favoriteButtonSlot={
        <TrackCard.FavoriteButton
          icon="FeatherHeart"
          onClick={() => {
            // Add any business logic here
          }}
        />
      }
    />
  )
}
```

The flexibility of slots lets you pass handlers, custom icons, or even swap in entirely different components. You can create [slots ↗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C9cRkvKbQY) using Subframe's component editor.

### Wrapping components

For logic not supported by Radix or slots, wrap the Subframe component:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/ui/components/Button"

export function SubmitButton({ onSubmit, ...props }) {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)

  async function handleClick() {
    setLoading(true)
    await onSubmit()
    setLoading(false)
  }

  return <Button {...props} loading={loading} onClick={handleClick} />
}
```

This is the recommended way to extend Subframe components. This keeps Subframe as the source of truth for the visual layer, but gives developers the flexibility of code to add any business logic.

<Note>In the future, we'll let you add component logic directly in Subframe.</Note>

### Disabling sync

As a last resort, disable sync for a component by adding this comment comment anywhere in the file:

```tsx
// @subframe/sync-disable
```

When the CLI is run, it will skip over any file that contains this comment.

You can alternatively copy/paste component code directly from Subframe if you need a one-off version.
