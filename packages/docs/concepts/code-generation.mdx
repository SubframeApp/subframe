Subframe generates production-ready React code deterministically—no LLM involved.

## How it works

When you make edits in Subframe, you're editing the underlying code directly. If it can't be translated to code, you can't do it in Subframe.

- **Deterministic** — The same design always produces the same code, without AI hallucinations or unexpected output.
- **Clean** — You get a minimal set of changes. No extra wrappers, one-off components, or redundant styles.
- **Responsive** — Changes reflect instantly, without waiting for AI calls.

## AI-ready output

Subframe's code is designed to work well with AI coding tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and Copilot.

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind is well-represented in AI training data, so models generate it reliably. Utility classes also make it easy to copy, paste, and refactor code after AI edits.

Subframe also syncs your theme to a Tailwind config file. In our testing, we find that a consistent theme helps AI tools generate code that matches your design system, rather than inventing arbitrary colors or spacing.

### Headless components

[Headless components](https://www.subframe.com/blog/how-headless-components-became-the-future-for-building-ui-libraries) separate styling from functionality, giving you:

- **Flexibility** — Restyle without breaking behavior
- **Composability** — Mix and match primitives
- **Accessibility** — Built-in ARIA support and keyboard navigation

Subframe uses [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/) for interactive behavior.

Headless components also provide guardrails for AI. We found that relying on a battle-tested library for component logic—rather than asking AI to build dropdowns, modals, and accordions from scratch—produces higher quality, more consistent code.

## Future support

We're exploring support for other frameworks and languages. If you're interested, [join our Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/subframecommunity/shared_invite/zt-380uma6dv-_lr7_bDLU5DJcoygfUYkeQ) and let us know what you'd like to see.
