title: Exporting pages
description: Export page designs to your codebase and add business logic.

Pages are screens built from components. Design the layout and UI in Subframe, then export and add business logic like API calls, state management, and routing in code.

## Using the MCP server (recommended)

The fastest way to export pages is through AI assistants connected to Subframe's [MCP server](/developers/mcp-server). Paste a page link and let AI integrate the design directly:

```text
Implement the design at https://app.subframe.com/PROJECT_ID/design/DESIGN_ID/edit.
Wire up relevant app logic where applicable.
```

AI fetches the latest design and generates code that fits your existing project structure. You can also ask AI to update existing pages when designs change:

```text
Update the existing page to match the Subframe design at
https://app.subframe.com/PROJECT_ID/design/DESIGN_ID/edit.

Preserve all existing functionality unless the new design requires a change.
```

## Copy and paste

You can also copy page code directly from Subframe:

1. Open the page in Subframe
2. Click **Code** > **Inspect**
3. Copy the React code

To export just part of a page, select the elements you want and the code panel will show only your selection.
