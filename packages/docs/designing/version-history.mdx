Version history lets you restore all changes for your entire project – from page designs, to component edits, to theme changes.

## Accessing version history

## Project-level versioning

Version history captures everything at the project level. When you restore a version, all changes are restored together, including:

- Page designs
- Component edits
- Theme changes
- All other project modifications

## Timeline view

New versions are automatically saved when you make changes. Navigate through your project history minute by minute using the timeline interface.

Click **Viewing latest version** to browse through previous versions, then click **Restore version** to go back to any point in time.

## Version retention

Version history retention varies by plan:

- **Free plan**: 24-hour history
- **Pro plan**: 7-day history
- **Custom plans**: Longer version history available

Contact the Subframe team for custom version history retention options.
