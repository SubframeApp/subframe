Subframe uses role-based access control to manage what team members can do. Every team member has one of four roles: Admin, Editor, Viewer, or Inactive.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Admin" icon="crown">
    Full access to everything. Admins manage team members, billing, and have complete design and code access. First person to create a team automatically becomes an Admin.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Editor" icon="pen">
    Full design and development access. Editors can create, edit, and delete projects, export code, and use AI features. They cannot manage team settings or billing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Viewer" icon="eye">
    Read-only access. Viewers can see designs but cannot edit, export code, or use AI features. Perfect for stakeholders who need visibility without editing capabilities.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Inactive" icon="user-slash">
    No access. Inactive members cannot sign in or access the team. Use this to temporarily remove access without deleting the team member entirely.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

When you attempt an action your role doesn't allow, Subframe shows a dialog explaining the restriction:
> "You are in view-only mode. You can view designs but cannot make edits or view code. Contact your team admin to request access."

## Changing roles

Admins can change any team member's role at any time:

1. Navigate to **Team Settings** from your user menu
2. Find the team member in the list
3. Click their current role dropdown
4. Select the new role

Role changes take effect immediately. The team member doesn't need to sign out and back in.

<Warning>
Changing from Editor or Admin to Viewer or Inactive affects billing. You'll stop being charged for that seat immediately.
</Warning>

## Billing implications

Roles directly affect your monthly cost:

- **Admin:** $29/month per seat (Pro plan)
- **Editor:** $29/month per seat (Pro plan)
- **Viewer:** Free, unlimited
- **Inactive:** Free (billing stops immediately when set to Inactive)

On the Free plan, you can have unlimited Viewers but no Editors or Admins beyond the team creator.

## First team member role

When you create a new Subframe team, you're automatically assigned the Admin role. This ensures you can configure the team and invite others.

When inviting new members through email, they default to the Editor role unless you explicitly choose a different role during invitation.

## Role restrictions

### AI features

Only Admins and Editors can use AI features like Ask AI and Prototyping. Viewers cannot access any AI features.

### Version history

Admins and Editors can view version history. While viewing a historical version, you can see designs and code but cannot make edits until you exit version history.

### Code export

Only Admins and Editors can export code. Viewers can see sync components and view designs but cannot access Code mode.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can't access a feature">

Check your role in Team Settings. Viewers cannot edit, export code, or use AI features. Ask an Admin to upgrade your role if needed.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can't change someone's role">

Only Admins can change roles. Editors cannot modify team member permissions. Contact your team Admin.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Billing didn't update after role change">

Role changes affect the next billing cycle, not immediately. View upcoming charges in the Stripe billing portal.
