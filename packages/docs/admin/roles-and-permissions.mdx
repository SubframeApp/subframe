title: Roles and permissions
description: Understand what each team role can access and modify in Subframe.
---

Subframe uses role-based access control to manage what team members can do. Every team member has one of four roles: Admin, Editor, Viewer, or Inactive.

## Available roles

**Admin** - Full access to everything. Admins manage team members, billing, and have complete design and code access. First person to create a team automatically becomes an Admin.

**Editor** - Full design and development access. Editors can create, edit, and delete projects, export code, and use AI features. They cannot manage team settings or billing.

**Viewer** - Read-only access. Viewers can see designs but cannot edit, export code, or use AI features. Perfect for stakeholders who need visibility without editing capabilities.

**Inactive** - No access. Inactive members cannot sign in or access the team. Use this to temporarily remove access without deleting the team member entirely.

### Design and code access

**Admins and Editors:**
- View, edit, and create components
- Design and edit pages
- Export code in any format
- Use AI features (prompt-to-design, image-to-design, inline Ask AI)
- View version history
- Create and delete projects

**Viewers:**
- View designs and components only
- Cannot edit anything
- Cannot export code
- Cannot use AI features
- Cannot view version history
- Cannot create or delete projects

**Inactive:**
- No access to any features
- Cannot sign in

### Team management

**Admins:**
- Invite Admins, Editors, and Viewers
- Change any team member's role
- Remove team members
- Manage billing and subscription
- Access team settings

**Editors:**
- Invite Editors and Viewers (cannot invite Admins)
- Cannot change roles or remove team members
- Cannot access billing or team settings

**Viewers:**
- Cannot invite anyone
- Cannot manage team members
- Cannot access team settings

**Inactive:**
- No team management access

### Billing access

Only Admins can view and manage billing. This includes:
- Updating payment methods
- Changing subscription plans
- Viewing invoices
- Managing billing contacts
- Canceling subscriptions

Editors and Viewers cannot see any billing information.

## Permission enforcement

When you attempt an action your role doesn't allow, Subframe shows a dialog explaining the restriction:

**For Viewers** - "You are in view-only mode. You can view designs but cannot make edits or view code. Contact your team admin to request access."

**When viewing version history** - Editors and Admins can view but not edit. "Exit version history to make edits. You can view designs and code but cannot make edits."

These restrictions apply across the entire application—in the editor, project settings, and team settings.

## Changing roles

Admins can change any team member's role at any time:

1. Navigate to **Team Settings** from your user menu
2. Find the team member in the list
3. Click their current role dropdown
4. Select the new role

Role changes take effect immediately. The team member doesn't need to sign out and back in.

<Warning>
Changing from Editor or Admin to Viewer or Inactive affects billing. You'll stop being charged for that seat immediately.
</Warning>

## Billing implications

Roles directly affect your monthly cost:

- **Admin:** $29/month per seat (Pro plan)
- **Editor:** $29/month per seat (Pro plan)
- **Viewer:** Free, unlimited
- **Inactive:** Free (billing stops immediately when set to Inactive)

On the Free plan, you can have unlimited Viewers but no Editors or Admins beyond the team creator.

## First team member role

When you create a new Subframe team, you're automatically assigned the Admin role. This ensures you can configure the team and invite others.

When inviting new members through email, they default to the Editor role unless you explicitly choose a different role during invitation.

## Role restrictions by feature

### AI features

Only Admins and Editors can use AI features like:
- Prompt-to-design
- Image-to-design
- Inline Ask AI
- Remix pages
- Chat with AI in Prototype mode

Viewers cannot access any AI features. If your team doesn't have AI enabled (based on your plan), these features are unavailable to everyone.

### Version history

Admins and Editors can view version history. While viewing a historical version, you can see designs and code but cannot make edits until you exit version history.

Viewers cannot access version history at all.

### Code export

Only Admins and Editors can export code. Viewers can see designs but cannot access Code mode or export components.

Export formats available to Admins and Editors:
- Copy component code
- Export to Cursor
- Export to Bolt
- Export to Replit
- Export to Lovable
- Sync via CLI
