Invite team members to collaborate on your Subframe projects. All team members have access to all projects—there are no project-level permissions.

## Sending invitations

Navigate to your user menu (top-right avatar) and select **Team Settings**.

Click **Invite team member** to open the invitation dialog.

Enter the email address and select a role:
- **Admin** - Full access including team and billing management
- **Editor** - Can edit designs and export code ($29/month on Pro plan)
- **Viewer** - Read-only access (free)

Click **Send invitation**. The recipient receives an email invitation with a link to join your team.

## Who can invite

Your role determines who you can invite:

**Admin** - Can invite Admins, Editors, and Viewers
**Editor** - Can invite Editors and Viewers
**Viewer** - Cannot invite anyone

## Invitation status

Pending invitations appear in the team settings table with a "Pending" badge. You can cancel pending invitations by clicking the **X** next to the invitation.

Once someone accepts, they appear as an active team member with their avatar, name, and assigned role.

## What team members can access

All team members see and work on the same projects. There are no project-level permissions—if you're on the team, you have access to all projects based on your role.

**Admins and Editors:**
- View, edit, and create components
- Design and edit pages
- Export code
- Use AI features
- Create and delete projects
- View version history

**Viewers:**
- View designs and components
- No editing or export capabilities
- Cannot use AI features
- Cannot create or delete projects

For detailed permissions, see [Roles and Permissions](/admin/roles-and-permissions).

## Accepting invitations

When invited to a team, you'll receive an email with an "Accept invitation" link. You can also see pending invitations in your user menu.

<Warning>
Accepting a team invitation removes you from your current team. If you're the only member of your current team, your projects transfer with you.
</Warning>

Click **Accept invitation** to join the team. You'll be signed out and redirected to sign in with the new team.

## Billing impact

Adding Editors or Admins increases your monthly cost on the Pro plan ($29 per editor seat). Viewers are always free regardless of how many you add.

Your billing updates automatically when team members join or when you change their roles.

## Limitations

**One team per account** - You can only be on one team at a time. Accepting a new invitation removes you from your current team.

**No guest access** - There's no way to share individual projects without adding someone to your full team.

**All projects shared** - Team members see all projects. You cannot restrict access to specific projects.
