title: Syncing components
description: Keep your codebase in sync with Subframe components using the CLI.
---

To use Subframe components in your app, you need to sync them to your codebase. This creates a local copy of the code for your components that stays in sync with your designs in Subframe.

<Note>
**Sync goes one way** from Subframe to your codebase. This means that if you make changes to a Subframe component's code in your codebase, those changes will be overwritten the next time you sync.
</Note>

## Running the sync command

Make sure to first [install Subframe](/installation/existing-project). To sync the code for all of your components to your codebase, run the following command:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npx @subframe/cli@latest sync --all
  ```
  ```bash yarn
  yarn dlx @subframe/cli@latest sync --all
  ```
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpx @subframe/cli@latest sync --all
  ```
  ```bash bun
  bunx --bun @subframe/cli@latest sync --all
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Sync specific components

You can also sync only specific components by providing their names as arguments:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npx @subframe/cli@latest sync Alert Accordion
  ```
  ```bash yarn
  yarn dlx @subframe/cli@latest sync Alert Accordion
  ```
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpx @subframe/cli@latest sync Alert Accordion
  ```
  ```bash bun
  bunx --bun @subframe/cli@latest sync Alert Accordion
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Command options

The sync command accepts several options:

```
Arguments:
  components                   the components to sync

Options:
  -a, --all                    sync all components
  -p, --projectId <projectId>  project id to run sync with
  -i, --install                install dependencies after syncing
  -h, --help                   display help for command
```

For example, to sync all components and automatically install dependencies:

```bash
npx @subframe/cli@latest sync --all --install
```

## When to sync

You should sync your components whenever you:

- **Create new components** in Subframe that you want to use in your codebase
- **Modify existing components** in Subframe (change styles, add variants, update props)
- **Pull changes** from teammates who updated components
- **Update your theme** (colors, typography, spacing)

Sync is fast and safe—it only updates the files that changed, so you can run it as often as you need.

## Disabling sync

If you make changes to a Subframe component's code in your codebase, those changes will be overwritten the next time you sync. To prevent your changes from being overwritten, you can disable syncing for that component by adding `// @subframe/sync-disable` anywhere in the component file:

```tsx src/ui/Accordion.tsx {1}
// @subframe/sync-disable

"use client";
/*
 * Documentation:
 * Accordion — https://app.subframe.com/library?component=Accordion_d2e81e20-863a-4027-826a-991d8910efd9
 */

...
```

<Warning>
Disabling sync should be used as a last resort when you need to change the core behavior of a component.
