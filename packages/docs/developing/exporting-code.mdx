description: Copy page code from Subframe to your codebase
---

Subframe generates production-ready React + Tailwind code programmatically—no AI, no approximations. Get code via the Code panel for precise control, or use the MCP server to implement designs with AI agents.

## Code generation

Everything in Subframe is code—not screenshots or design specs. The Code panel shows programmatically generated code that matches your design pixel-perfect.

Generated code is deterministic. The same design always produces identical code with clean TypeScript, semantic HTML, and optimized Tailwind classes.

Subframe provides a sandbox for "design with code" without managing build tools or deployment. Designers see exactly what ships. Developers copy working code, not interpreted mockups.

<Note>
Components sync automatically via the CLI. Pages are exported manually (copy-paste or MCP). This separation keeps your component library in sync while giving you full control over page-level code.

## Getting code

### MCP server (recommended)

The [MCP server](/developing/mcp-server) connects AI coding assistants like Claude Code and Cursor to your Subframe projects:

```text
Implement the dashboard at https://app.subframe.com/PROJECT_ID/design/DESIGN_ID
```

AI fetches the design and implements it with routing, state management, and API integration.

Use this for complete pages with business logic, especially in existing codebases.

### Code panel

The [Code panel](/editor/code-mode/inspecting-code) shows generated code for any element or page. Select elements to see code for specific sections instead of the full page.

Use this to inspect components, debug layouts, or control exactly what code gets copied.

## Exporting pages

Pages need customization after export:

- **State management** - React hooks for forms, modals, loading states
- **API integration** - Data fetching, mutations, error handling
- **Business logic** - Validation, authentication, authorization
- **Routing** - Next.js, React Router, or framework integration
- **Dynamic content** - Real data replacing design placeholders

Subframe doesn't automatically sync pages because you own the code after export. Add any logic you need without worrying about overwrites.

| | Components | Pages |
|---|---|---|
| **Workflow** | Sync automatically via CLI | Export manually |
| **Customization** | Minimal (use as-is or wrap) | Extensive (add logic, data, routing) |
| **Updates** | Pull latest with `sync` command | Re-export selectively when design changes |
| **Ownership** | Subframe maintains the code | You own and modify the code |

## Using Code panel

Click **Code** in the top-right to switch to Code Mode. The Code panel shows:

1. **Installation snippet** - Command to sync components used on the page
2. **Import list** - All component imports needed
3. **Generated code** - Complete React component with TypeScript types

Select individual elements on the canvas to inspect code for just that selection. Useful for understanding layouts, debugging spacing, or copying single sections.

Click **Copy code** to copy the entire page component:

```tsx src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
// Pasted from Subframe
import { Button } from "@/ui/Button";
import { Card } from "@/ui/Card";
import { StatCard } from "@/ui/StatCard";

export default function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div className="flex h-full w-full flex-col items-start gap-6 bg-default-background px-6 py-6">
      <div className="flex w-full items-center gap-4">
        <span className="text-heading-1 font-heading-1 text-default-font">
          Dashboard
        </span>
      </div>
      <div className="grid w-full grid-cols-3 gap-4">
        {/* Replace with real data */}
        <StatCard label="Revenue" value="$45,231" />
        <StatCard label="Users" value="1,234" />
        <StatCard label="Growth" value="+12%" />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now add your application logic. See [Adding business logic](/developing/adding-business-logic) for detailed examples.

## Updating designs

Finalize designs in Subframe before exporting. Once you've added business logic, merging design updates requires care.

When designs change, choose the approach that fits:

**Selective re-export** - Copy just the changed section from Subframe, replace that part of your file. Works well for isolated UI changes like button styling or spacing adjustments.

**MCP re-implementation** - Ask the AI agent to update the implementation to match the new design while preserving your business logic.

**Manual edits** - Update code directly for small changes. Often faster than re-exporting for color or spacing tweaks.

Always commit before making design-driven changes. This makes diffs reviewable and changes reversible.
