## Documentation

Subframe gives you a customizable design system that's exported as React code. To understand the React props available for a component, view its documentation.

1. Open Subframe and click on the [Components](https://app.subframe.com/library/overview) tab in the top nav.
2. Click on the component you want either in the left sidebar or in the middle.
3. You should now see documentation for the React props, source code, and interactive examples.

## Importing Subframe components in code

After [syncing the components](/developing/syncing-components) to your repository, you can use a Subframe component in your code. Import it directly or use the import alias you set up during installation:

```tsx src/App.tsx {1, 5-10}
import { Alert } from "@/ui/components/Alert"

function App() {
  return (
    <Alert
      variant="neutral"
      icon="FeatherInfo"
      title="A great title for an alert"
      description="Describe what's happening in more detail."
    />
  )
}

export default App
```
