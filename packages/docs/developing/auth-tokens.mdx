description: Generate API tokens for CLI and MCP access
---

Access tokens authenticate the Subframe CLI and MCP server with your account. Generate them once in the Subframe app, then use them in your local environment.

Each token has the same permissions you do. If you can access a project in Subframe, your token can too.

## Creating a token

1. Go to [app.subframe.com/cli/auth](https://app.subframe.com/cli/auth)
2. Click **Generate new token**
3. Copy the token immediately—it's only shown once

<Warning>
Save your token securely. Once you leave this page, you can't view it again. Generate a new one if lost.
</Warning>

The token looks like: `sfr_abc123xyz...`

### First-time CLI setup

The CLI prompts for a token when you run:

```bash
npx @subframe/cli init
```

Paste your token when prompted. The CLI saves it locally—you don't need to enter it again.

## Using tokens

### CLI authentication

The CLI uses your saved token automatically:

```bash
# Sync all components
npx @subframe/cli sync --all

# Sync specific component
npx @subframe/cli sync Button

# Check CLI status
npx @subframe/cli status
```

The CLI stores your token in your home directory.

### MCP server configuration

The MCP server uses HTTP transport with Bearer token authentication. See [MCP Server](/developing/mcp-server) for complete installation instructions.

## Managing tokens

Delete tokens at [app.subframe.com/settings/tokens](https://app.subframe.com/settings/tokens). Click **Revoke** next to any token to delete it immediately.

All tools using that token stop working until you generate and configure a new one.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Authentication failed">

Check that you copied the entire token without spaces. Verify it hasn't been revoked. Generate a fresh token if needed at [app.subframe.com/settings/tokens](https://app.subframe.com/settings/tokens).

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="CLI not finding token">

Re-authenticate with `npx @subframe/cli init` to save your token locally. The CLI stores tokens in your home directory.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="MCP server not working">

Check your configuration file for typos. Verify the Bearer token in the Authorization header. Restart your AI tool after updating the config.
