title: Props and slots
description: Understand when to use props vs slots for customizing Subframe components.
---

Components accept two types of customization: **props** and **slots**.

**Props** are simple values—text, numbers, booleans, icons, images. Configure props in the Inspector panel when using components. In code, pass props like any React component.

**Slots** are placeholders for React children. They enable composition—nesting components inside other components. Designers define slots and add default content. Developers fill slots with custom components, event handlers, and framework-specific elements.

## When to use each

Use **props** for content that changes per instance: titles, labels, colors, icons, image URLs.

Use **slots** when you need:
- Event handlers on subcomponents (`onClick`, `onChange`)
- Framework-specific components (Next.js `Image`, custom wrappers)
- Complex nested content with its own state and logic

## Example: Props vs slots

A `TrackCard` component with only props accepts simple values but can't expose event handlers or framework components:

```tsx
<TrackCard
  title="The Less I Know The Better"
  artist="Tame Impala"
  image="/covers/tame_impala.jpg"  // Static URL only, no Next.js Image
  // No way to add onClick to favorite button
/>
```

The same component with slots exposes subcomponents and accepts React elements:

```tsx
<TrackCard
  title="The Less I Know The Better"
  artist="Tame Impala"
  favoriteButton={
    <TrackCard.FavoriteButton
      icon={isFavorite ? "FeatherHeartOff" : "FeatherHeart"}
      onClick={() => setIsFavorite(!isFavorite)}
    />
  }
  image={
    <Image
      src="/covers/tame_impala.jpg"
      alt="Tame Impala Currents Cover"
      fill
    />
  }
/>
```

Slots enable event handlers, Next.js optimized images, and full control over nested components.

## Creating props and slots

Add props and slots when creating or editing components. See [Creating Components](/components/creating-components) for detailed instructions.

**Props:** Select an element → Inspector panel → **+ Add property** → Choose type (Text, Boolean, Enum, Icon, Image, Number)

**Slots:** Select a Stack → Right-click → **Add slot** → Name the slot → Add default content

Slots export as React props that accept JSX. Props export as TypeScript interface properties.
