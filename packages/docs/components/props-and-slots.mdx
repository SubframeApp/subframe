title: Props and slots
description: Understand when to use props vs slots for customizing Subframe components.
---

In Subframe, you can customize components using two primary methods: **props** and **slots**.

- **Props** — Ideal for customizing simple, static content such as text, image URLs, numbers, or other basic data types.
- **Slots** — Provide greater flexibility by allowing you to insert arbitrary React nodes directly into components. Slots utilize the [React composition pattern](https://felixgerschau.com/react-component-composition/), offering more control and interactivity while avoiding prop drilling.

## When to use each

Use **props** for straightforward, static content updates like titles, labels, image URLs, and simple data.

Use **slots** when you require dynamic content or need access to specific subcomponent properties like event handlers (`onClick`, `onChange`) or attributes (`alt`, `src`).

## Comparing props and slots

Let's compare two implementations of a `TrackCard` component from the [Adding business logic](/develop/adding-business-logic#example-2-interactive-track-cards) guide.

<CodeGroup>

```tsx src/components/TrackCard.tsx (with only props) [expandable]
"use client"
import { TrackCardWithProps } from "@/ui/components/TrackCardWithProps"

function TrackCardWithPropsExample() {
  const [isFavorite, setIsFavorite] = useState<boolean>(false)

  function handleFavoriteClick() {
    setIsFavorite((prev) => !prev)
  }

  const favoriteIcon = isFavorite ? "FeatherHeartOff" : "FeatherHeart"

  return (
    <TrackCardWithProps
      title="The Less I Know The Better"
      artist="Tame Impala"
      length="3:38"
      genre="Disco"
      // We can only pass a static image URL here and no alt text,
      // since the props for the underlying <img /> are not exposed
      image="/covers/tame_impala-currents.jpg"
      // We have no way to add an onClick handler or an icon to our
      // FavoriteButton here, since it's events are not exposed
    />
  )
}

export default TrackCardWithPropsExample
```

```tsx src/components/TrackCard.tsx (with slots) [expandable]
"use client"
import { TrackCardWithSlots } from "@/ui/components/TrackCardWithSlots"
import Image from "next/image"

function TrackCardWithSlotsExample() {
  const [isFavorite, setIsFavorite] = useState<boolean>(false)

  function handleFavoriteClick() {
    setIsFavorite((prev) => !prev)
  }

  const favoriteIcon = isFavorite ? "FeatherHeartOff" : "FeatherHeart"

  return (
    <TrackCardWithSlots
      title="The Less I Know The Better"
      artist="Tame Impala"
      length="3:38"
      // We can pass in an onClick handler
      // and icon to the FavoriteButton here,
      // since it's props are now exposed
      favoriteButtonSlot={<TrackCardWithSlots.FavoriteButton icon={favoriteIcon} onClick={handleFavoriteClick} />}
      imageSlot={
        // We can pass an arbitrary React node here
        // such as Next's <Image /> component,
        // allowing us to optimize images and add alt text
        <Image src="/covers/tame_impala-currents.jpg" alt="Tame Impala Currents Cover Art" fill={true} />
      }
      genre="Disco"
    />
  )
}

export default TrackCardWithSlotsExample
```

</CodeGroup>

With **props only**, we're limited to passing simple values. We can't attach event handlers to the favorite button or use Next.js's optimized `Image` component.

With **slots**, we have full control. We can pass custom event handlers, use framework-specific components, and access all the props we need.

## Benefits of slots

### Access to subcomponent props

Slots expose the full API of nested components, including event handlers like `onClick`, `onChange`, and `onSubmit`. This lets you add interactivity without modifying the synced component.

### Framework integration

Use framework-specific components like Next.js's `Image` or custom wrappers. Slots accept any React node, so you can integrate with your existing component library seamlessly.

### Full flexibility

Pass any React element, including complex components with their own state and logic. Slots support the full power of React composition.

<Tip>
Subcomponents help clarify intended usage by explicitly exposing slots and relevant props to the consumer of a component. The `<TrackCardWithSlots.FavoriteButton />` subcomponent is a good example of this in the code above.
</Tip>

When using subcomponents, you can expose all necessary props and slots while ensuring that the component is easy to use and understand.
