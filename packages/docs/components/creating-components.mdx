Build reusable patterns specific to your product with custom components. They sync to code, support props and slots, and update automatically across all instances.

## Creating from existing design

The fastest way to create a component is from elements you've already designed.

1. Select the elements (<kbd>Shift</kbd> + click or drag to select)
2. Right-click → **Create component**
3. Name your component (use PascalCase: ProductCard, FeatureSection, UserAvatar)
4. Review AI-suggested properties
5. Click **Create**

### AI-powered property suggestions

Subframe analyzes your selection and automatically suggests properties based on content it detects:

- **Text elements** become text props (titles, descriptions, labels)
- **Icons** become icon props with current icon as default
- **Images** become image props

Toggle suggested properties on or off in the creation dialog. Rename properties to match your terminology—these become your component's prop names in code.

## Creating from scratch

Start with a blank component for full control:

1. Navigate to **Components** tab (top nav)
2. Click **+ New component**
3. Name your component
4. Build your component structure with stacks, text, icons, and other elements
5. Add properties as needed

Use a Stack as your root element—it provides flexible layout and works well as a component container.

## Adding properties

Properties make your component configurable. Add them by selecting an element and clicking **+ Add property** in the Inspector panel.

**Property types:**

- **Text** - Editable text content (titles, labels, descriptions)
- **Boolean** - Show/hide toggles
- **Enum** - Dropdown choices (variants like size or style)
- **Icon** - Icon selection from icon libraries
- **Image** - Image URLs or uploads
- **Number** - Numeric values
- **Slot** - Flexible content areas for React children

Each property exports as a TypeScript prop with full type safety.

## Variants

Variants are pre-configured versions of your component created using enum properties. Common patterns:

**Size variants** - Create a "size" enum property with options: small, medium, large. For each option, adjust padding, font size, and spacing.

**Style variants** - Create a "variant" enum property with options: primary, secondary, destructive. For each option, change colors and visual styling.

**Layout variants** - Create a "layout" enum property with options: horizontal, vertical. For each option, adjust Stack direction and arrangement.

To style variant options, select the enum value from the dropdown in the component editor, then apply styles—those styles only apply to that variant.

## States

States define how components look during interaction. Add states from the States dropdown in the component editor:

**Hover** - Mouse over the component `:hover`
**Pressed** - Active/pressed state `:active`
**Focused** - Keyboard focus (important for accessibility) `:focus-visible`

## Slots

Slots enable component composition by accepting React children. To create a slot:

1. Select a Stack in your component
2. Right-click → **Add slot**
3. Name the slot (e.g., "actions", "header", "content")
4. Add default content that appears when the slot is empty

Slots export as props that accept JSX:

```tsx
<Card
  title="Product"
  actions={<Button>Buy now</Button>}
>
  <ProductImage />
  <ProductDescription />
</Card>
```

For guidance on when to use slots vs props, see [Props and Slots](/components/props-and-slots).

## Component structure

**Use Stacks for layout** - Start with a Stack as root and use nested Stacks to organize elements. Stacks provide flexible flexbox layout.

**Name your layers** - Give elements descriptive names in the Layers panel: "icon-wrapper", "title-text", "action-button". This makes components easier to maintain.

**Keep components focused** - A component should do one thing well. If it's getting complex, break it into multiple components.

## Saving and syncing

Components auto-save as you work. Once saved, your component appears in the component library under "Custom" and can be used in any page.

To sync components to your codebase:

```bash
npx @subframe/cli sync --all
```

Your component exports as TypeScript React code with full type safety:

```tsx ProductCard.tsx
import * as React from "react"

export interface ProductCardProps {
  title: string
  description: string
  price: string
  image: string
  size?: "small" | "medium" | "large"
  variant?: "default" | "featured"
}

export const ProductCard = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, ProductCardProps>(
  function ProductCard({ size = "medium", variant = "default", ...props }, ref) {
    // Generated component implementation
  }
)
```

## Editing components

Edit any component—base or custom—the same way:

1. Go to **Components** tab (top nav)
2. Select your component
3. Make changes in the component editor
4. All instances update automatically

Or right-click any instance → **Edit component** to open the editor.

Base components from Subframe are fully editable. Change colors, layouts, variants, states—they work identically to custom components. Changes you make update all instances across all pages immediately.
