title: Importing components
description: Import components from other projects or external code.
---

Import existing components into your Subframe project instead of building from scratch. Share components across projects or bring in components from external codebases.

## Import from another project

Copy components from one Subframe project to another, including all dependencies and assets.

### Import workflow

1. Navigate to **Components** tab
2. Click **Import** → **From another project**
3. Select source project from dropdown
4. Browse and select components to import
5. Click **Import**

### What gets imported

When you import a component, Subframe includes all dependencies:

- **Component definitions** — The component and all subcomponents
- **Theme tokens** — Colors, typography, borders, corners, shadows used by the component
- **Assets** — Fonts, icons, and images referenced by the component

Imported components appear in your component library and can be customized independently from the source project.

### Selecting components

The import dialog shows two sections:

**Components** — Custom components you've created (excludes base components)

**Pages** — Page designs that can be imported as components

Search by name to find specific components. Select multiple components to import them together.

<Note>
Changes to the source project don't sync to imported components. Each project maintains its own copy.
</Note>

## Import from code

Import React components from your existing codebase into Subframe.

## After importing

**Review imported components** — Open each component in the editor to verify it imported correctly. Check that all properties, variants, and styling transferred.

**Customize as needed** — Imported components are fully editable. Modify colors, layouts, properties to match your project's design system.

**Sync to code** — Run `npx @subframe/cli sync --all` to add imported components to your codebase.
