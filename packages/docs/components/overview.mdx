description: Build and maintain your design system visually with React + Tailwind components.
---

Subframe lets you create custom component libraries using React + Tailwind—entirely visually. Build a design system from scratch, match an existing one for high-fidelity prototyping, or start with Subframe's base components and customize from there.

Your component library becomes the single source of truth. Designers own and evolve the system in Subframe, engineers sync the generated code to production. Changes flow one way: design to code.

## Base components

Every Subframe project starts with a base component library—buttons, inputs, cards, navigation, overlays, and more. These components are built on [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) and [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/), providing accessible, production-ready primitives.

**Built by Subframe** components are yours to customize. Change colors, modify layouts, add variants, adjust spacing—they're the foundation you build on, not a locked template.

Use them as-is for rapid prototyping, or customize them to match your brand and design system requirements.

## Building your design system

Subframe is built for creating production component libraries visually:

**Customize base components** - Modify existing components to match your design system. Change the Button component's variants, add new TextField patterns, adjust Card layouts—all visually, no code required.

**Create custom components** - Build new components from scratch for your specific needs. Design once, reuse everywhere. Changes sync automatically to all instances and to your codebase.

**Define variants and states** - Create size variants (sm, md, lg), style variants (primary, secondary, destructive), and interaction states (hover, pressed, focused, disabled). All generated as type-safe React props.

**Add props and slots** - Configure components with simple props (text, numbers, booleans) or flexible slots for complex composition. Export as TypeScript interfaces with full autocomplete.

## Single source of truth

Your Subframe component library is the authoritative source for your design system:

**Designers control the system** - Make changes in Subframe's visual editor without touching code. Update colors, refine spacing, add new variants—changes propagate automatically.

**Engineers sync to production** - Run `npx @subframe/cli sync` to update component code in your codebase. Components export as TypeScript React code with Tailwind styling, ready to use.

**One-way sync** - Changes flow from Subframe to code. Engineers wrap components with business logic but never edit the generated files directly. This keeps design and code in sync.

**Team collaboration** - Designers iterate in Subframe, engineers integrate in their codebase. No handoff friction, no drift between design and implementation.

## Component anatomy

Components in Subframe have several key features:

**Props** - Simple values like text, colors, or icons that configure component instances. Props export as TypeScript interface properties with type safety and autocomplete.

**Slots** - Placeholders for React children that enable component composition. Pass any React element into a slot—buttons, images, custom components, or complex trees.

**Variants** - Pre-configured versions of a component like size options (small, medium, large) or style variations (primary, secondary, ghost). Switch variants from a dropdown instead of setting individual properties.

**States** - Visual changes based on interaction: hover, pressed, focused, disabled. Design each state visually and they export as CSS pseudo-classes.

For detailed guidance on when to use each, see [Props and Slots](/components/props-and-slots).

## Syncing to code

When you run `npx @subframe/cli sync`, Subframe generates TypeScript React components with:

- Full TypeScript types and interfaces
- Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- Radix UI or Headless UI primitives (when applicable)
- Forward refs, event handlers, and React composition patterns
- Responsive design with mobile overrides

Components sync one-way from Subframe to your codebase. Changes in Subframe overwrite generated files, so wrap components in your own files for business logic instead of editing directly.

```tsx Button.tsx (generated by Subframe)
import * as React from "react"
import * as SubframeCore from "@subframe/core"

export interface ButtonProps extends React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"button"> {
  variant?: "brand-primary" | "brand-secondary" | "neutral" | "destructive"
  size?: "small" | "medium" | "large"
  icon?: SubframeCore.IconName
  children?: string
}

export const Button = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>(
  function Button({ variant = "brand-primary", size = "medium", ...props }, ref) {
    return (
      <button
        className={/* Tailwind classes based on variant and size */}
        ref={ref}
        {...props}
      />
    )
  }
)
```

## Importing existing systems

Subframe supports multiple ways to bring existing design systems into the platform:

**Import from code (coming soon)** - Import existing React + Tailwind components from your codebase into Subframe for high-fidelity design and prototyping. Reach out to support@subframe.com for early access.

**Import theme tokens** - Import color palettes, typography scales, and spacing systems from Figma or other design tools. Your theme tokens apply automatically to all components.

**Recreate visually** - Use Subframe's visual editor to rebuild components that match your existing system. Faster than you'd expect, and you get a design system designers can maintain.

<Note>
Direct Figma component import is not currently supported, but we're working on it. In the meantime, you can import theme tokens and rebuild components visually.
