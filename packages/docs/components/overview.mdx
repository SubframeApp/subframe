description: Build and maintain your design system visually with React + Tailwind components.
---

Build component libraries using React + Tailwind through a visual editor. Create a design system from scratch, match an existing one for prototyping, or customize Subframe's base components.

Designers own and evolve components in Subframe, engineers sync generated code to production. Changes flow one way: design to code.

## Base components

Every Subframe project starts with base components—buttons, inputs, cards, navigation, overlays. Components are built on [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) and [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/), providing accessible primitives.

**Built by Subframe** components are fully customizable. Change colors, modify layouts, add variants, adjust spacing. Base components and custom components have identical editing capabilities—foundation you build on, not a locked template.

## Building your design system

Build production component libraries visually:

**Customize base components** - Modify existing components to match your design system. Colors, spacing, layouts, variants—fully editable.

**Create custom components manually** - Build new components from existing page designs or from scratch. Select elements, right-click, create component. Design once, reuse everywhere.

**Generate pages first, componentize second** - Best practice: use AI to generate pages, then manually create components from repeated patterns. AI doesn't create or update components directly (coming soon).

**Define variants and states** - Create size variants (sm, md, lg), style variants (primary, secondary, destructive), and interaction states (hover, pressed, focused, disabled).

**Add props and slots** - Configure components with simple props (text, numbers, booleans) or slots for composition. Export as TypeScript interfaces with autocomplete.

## Design to code workflow

**Designers control the system** - Make changes in visual editor without touching code. Update colors, refine spacing, add variants—changes propagate automatically.

**Engineers sync to production** - Run `npx @subframe/cli sync` to update component code. Components export as TypeScript React code with Tailwind styling.

**One-way sync** - Changes flow from Subframe to code. Engineers wrap components with business logic but don't edit generated files.

## Component anatomy

**Props** - Simple values like text, colors, or icons that configure instances.

**Slots** - Placeholders for React children that enable composition.

**Variants** - Pre-configured versions like size options (sm, md, lg) or style variations (primary, secondary, destructive).

**States** - Visual changes based on interaction: hover, pressed, focused, disabled.

See [Creating Components](/components/creating-components) and [Props and Slots](/components/props-and-slots) for details.

## Syncing to code

Run `npx @subframe/cli sync` to generate TypeScript React components with full type safety, Tailwind styling, and accessible primitives. Components sync one-way from Subframe to codebase—changes in Subframe overwrite generated files.

For details, see [Syncing Components](/developing/syncing-components).
