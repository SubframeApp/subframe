description: Build and maintain your design system visually with React + Tailwind components.
---

Create custom component libraries using React + Tailwind through a visual editor. Build a design system from scratch, match an existing one for prototyping, or customize Subframe's base components.

Your component library is the source of truth. Designers own and evolve the system in Subframe, engineers sync generated code to production. Changes flow one way: design to code.

## Base components

Every Subframe project starts with base components—buttons, inputs, cards, navigation, overlays. Components are built on [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) and [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/), providing accessible primitives.

**Built by Subframe** components are yours to customize. Change colors, modify layouts, add variants, adjust spacing—foundation you build on, not a locked template.

Use as-is for rapid prototyping, or customize to match your brand and design system.

## Building your design system

Subframe creates production component libraries visually:

**Customize base components** - Modify existing components to match your design system. Change Button variants, add TextField patterns, adjust Card layouts—all visual, no code.

**Create custom components** - Build new components from scratch for specific needs. Design once, reuse everywhere. Changes sync to all instances and codebase.

**Define variants and states** - Create size variants (sm, md, lg), style variants (primary, secondary, destructive), and interaction states (hover, pressed, focused, disabled). Generated as type-safe React props.

**Add props and slots** - Configure components with simple props (text, numbers, booleans) or flexible slots for complex composition. Export as TypeScript interfaces with autocomplete.

## Design to code workflow

Your Subframe component library is authoritative:

**Designers control the system** - Make changes in visual editor without touching code. Update colors, refine spacing, add variants—changes propagate automatically.

**Engineers sync to production** - Run `npx @subframe/cli sync` to update component code in your codebase. Components export as TypeScript React code with Tailwind styling.

**One-way sync** - Changes flow from Subframe to code. Engineers wrap components with business logic but don't edit generated files. This keeps design and code in sync.

**Team collaboration** - Designers iterate in Subframe, engineers integrate in codebase. No handoff friction, no drift between design and implementation.

## Component anatomy

Components have several key features:

**Props** - Simple values like text, colors, or icons that configure instances. Props export as TypeScript interface properties with type safety and autocomplete.

**Slots** - Placeholders for React children that enable composition. Pass any React element into a slot—buttons, images, custom components, or complex trees.

**Variants** - Pre-configured versions like size options (small, medium, large) or style variations (primary, secondary, ghost). Switch variants from dropdown instead of setting individual properties.

**States** - Visual changes based on interaction: hover, pressed, focused, disabled. Design each state visually and they export as CSS pseudo-classes.

For detailed guidance, see [Props and Slots](/components/props-and-slots).

## Syncing to code

When you run `npx @subframe/cli sync`, Subframe generates TypeScript React components with:

- Full TypeScript types and interfaces
- Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- Radix UI or Headless UI primitives (when applicable)
- Forward refs, event handlers, and React composition patterns
- Responsive design with mobile overrides

Components sync one-way from Subframe to codebase. Changes in Subframe overwrite generated files, so wrap components in your own files for business logic instead of editing directly.

```tsx Button.tsx (generated by Subframe)
import * as React from "react"
import * as SubframeCore from "@subframe/core"

export interface ButtonProps extends React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"button"> {
  variant?: "brand-primary" | "brand-secondary" | "neutral" | "destructive"
  size?: "small" | "medium" | "large"
  icon?: SubframeCore.IconName
  children?: string
}

export const Button = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>(
  function Button({ variant = "brand-primary", size = "medium", ...props }, ref) {
    return (
      <button
        className={/* Tailwind classes based on variant and size */}
        ref={ref}
        {...props}
      />
    )
  }
)
```

For more on syncing, see [Syncing Components](/developing/syncing-components).

## Importing existing systems

Subframe supports multiple ways to bring existing design systems into the platform:

**Import from code (coming soon)** - Import existing React + Tailwind components from your codebase for high-fidelity design and prototyping. Reach out to support@subframe.com for early access.

**Import theme tokens** - Import color palettes, typography scales, and spacing systems from Figma or other tools. Theme tokens apply to all components.

**Recreate visually** - Use visual editor to rebuild components that match your existing system. Faster than expected, and designers can maintain the system.

<Note>
Direct Figma component import is not currently supported. Import theme tokens and rebuild components visually.
