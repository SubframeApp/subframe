Designers and developers have always worked in separate tools: designers make mockups, developers translate them to code. But what ships never quite matches what was designed, and developers had wasted hours making it that way.

Subframe is a design tool that eliminates the translation step. Designers use the same components you ship to production, so you spend more time building product, not translating designs.

## Code quality matters

Unlike other AI design tools, **Subframe's code output is deterministic.** There's no LLM misinterpreting your design—what is designed is exactly what you get in clean React code, every time.

Our code philosophy:

- **Consistent** — All designs are created from the same consistent design system. No more custom, one-off implementations.

- **Open code** — Avoid platform lock-in. Code generated by Subframe lives in your codebase, copy/pasted or [synced via the CLI](/concepts/syncing-components).

- **Headless** — Subframe uses [Radix <Icon className="mb-1" size={12} icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" />](https://www.radix-ui.com/) under the hood, which maintains a cleaner separation of concerns between presentation and behavior.

- **AI-ready** — The generated code follows best practices to be modified further by AI tools like Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot. You can even connect these tools to Subframe's [MCP server](/guides/mcp-server) to grant direct access to your designs.

## Workflow example

Suppose your designer designs a sign in page in Subframe:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/developers/signin-page-example.png" alt="Login page designed in Subframe" />
</Frame>

Subframe turns the designs into pixel-perfect React code determinstically. The generated code uses your design system components, with stubs for business logic:

<CodeGroup>

<SignInPageCode />
<ButtonComponentCode />
<SocialSignInButtonCode />

</CodeGroup>

All that's left is to export it to your codebase and add business logic. You can do that manually or with AI assistants like Cursor or Claude Code connected to our MCP server:

<SignInPageWithLogic />

That's it.

You just went from design to production-ready code in minutes, without translating mockups or pixel-pushing. With Subframe, you focus on the real engineering work.
